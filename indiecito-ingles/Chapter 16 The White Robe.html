<p><span style="font-size:26px;"><strong>Chapter 16: The White Robe</strong></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">All five of Carlos&rsquo;s children responded to the invitation to attend the fiftieth anniversary of their aging parents. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming,&rdquo; &nbsp;they said. &ldquo;You sacrificed so much to help us get our educa tion. We want to show our appreciation for all you have done for us.&rdquo; Hundreds of people packed the Plater&iacute;a Adventist church on a &nbsp;bright December day to celebrate the anniversary. Less than a thou sand feet from the gate where they first met at the home originally built &nbsp;by Pastor Stahl, Carlos and Naomi walked down the aisle together, and &nbsp;the Lake Titicaca Mission president led them in renewing vows they &nbsp;had made fifty years before.<br />
All the children and grandchildren were there. Yban and his fam ily flew in from the United States. Jaime and his family came all the &nbsp;way from Mexico. Yban, the oldest living son, led out in paying trib ute to their parents. Carlos responded by telling about the benefits of &nbsp;Christian education.<br />
&ldquo;My paternal grandparents,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;rejected the teaching of pio neer missionary Ferdinand Stahl and wanted nothing to do with the &nbsp;schools he founded. They had no education and lived in misery. My &nbsp;parents were ignorant too, but God worked on their hearts, and al though they wanted nothing to do with the mission school, they sent &nbsp;me to Colegio San Carlos in Puno.<br />
&ldquo;When I asked to go to Colegio Adventista del Lago Titicaca, they &nbsp;said, &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; but the Holy Spirit changed their minds. My years at &nbsp;Chullunquiani, now an Adventist university, changed my life. And, &nbsp;thank God, when my parents accepted Christ, their lives changed too. &nbsp;All my children have been educated in Adventist schools, and I&rsquo;m &nbsp;amazed at what God has done for our family in just four generations. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll always be grateful for pioneer missionaries like Ferdinand and &nbsp;Ana Stahl, who sacrificed to help our people. I want to meet the Stahls &nbsp;when Jesus comes.&rdquo;<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">After the service in the church, a reception was held in the large &nbsp;patio of Colegio Fernando Stahl&mdash;a school named in honor of its &nbsp;founder. Leaders from the Mission, pastors from the area, church &nbsp;members, former students, family, and friends, all rejoiced for a couple &nbsp;who served God and stayed true to each other for fifty years.<br />
&ldquo;This has been an incredible day,&rdquo; Carlos told his family. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the &nbsp;first time we&rsquo;ve all been together for years. We doubted it could hap pen. And what a joy to meet our grandchildren from Mexico and the &nbsp;United States.&rdquo;<br />
Yban and Jaime smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not over yet. We&rsquo;re taking you and all the &nbsp;family to Cusco and Machu Picchu. We&rsquo;ll leave in the morning.&rdquo; Carlos &nbsp;had visited the famous Inca ruins during a teacher&rsquo;s retreat, but for Naomi &nbsp;this would be a first. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not only will I get to visit &nbsp;Cusco again, but I can visit a famous Inca site I&rsquo;ve heard about all my life.&rdquo;<br />
After several days traveling together, the family ended up back at &nbsp;Carlos and Naomi&rsquo;s home in Utawilaya. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a delight to honor &nbsp;our parents and visit our brothers who work for the Adventist church &nbsp;here in Peru,&rdquo; Yban said. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;re happy for a dedicated sister who &nbsp;works as a nurse serving Aymaras here in the Altiplano.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Listen, Mom and Dad,&rdquo; the two older brothers continued. &ldquo;The &nbsp;celebration isn&rsquo;t over yet. We want you to apply for Peruvian passports &nbsp;and visas for Mexico and the United States. We&rsquo;re sending you tickets &nbsp;to come and visit us. You need to get to know your grandchildren and &nbsp;see where we live.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos and Naomi gasped in unbelief. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never been out of &nbsp;Peru except to walk across the Desaguadero Bridge into Bolivia.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; their sons said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll arrange everything.&rdquo; The next week, Carlos and Naomi applied for passports. Later, in &nbsp;Lima, they got visas. People asked them, &ldquo;How can poor Indians like &nbsp;you get your visas so fast? We&rsquo;ve been trying for months.&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Adventistas,&rdquo; Carlos replied. &ldquo;Our sons are doctors, and &nbsp;they arranged everything.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What are Adventistas?&rdquo; they asked.<br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re Protestants who study the Bible and live to please Jesus.&rdquo; &ldquo;We need to become Adventistas too!&rdquo;<br />
Carlos thought, Maybe it&rsquo;s an advantage to be a little Indian, espe cially if you are an Adventista. One thing for sure&mdash;it&rsquo;s an advantage to &nbsp;be a Christian. Instead of just flying to Mexico or the United States, when &nbsp;Jesus comes we can travel through space all the way to heaven.<br />
132</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Carlos and his bride of fifty years checked in at the ticket counter, &nbsp;passed through immigration, and boarded a huge jet. Holding hands &nbsp;in a plane loaded with passengers, they roared off the runway at Lima&rsquo;s &nbsp;Jorge Chavez International Airport. Soon they were flying over Peru&rsquo;s &nbsp;highest mountain, Huascar&aacute;n.<br />
Six hours in the air took them from the land of the Incas to Mexico &nbsp;City and the home of the Aztecs, followed by a long drive with Jaime to &nbsp;his home in Oaxaca. &ldquo;What I like most,&rdquo; Carlos said, &ldquo;is to find our son &nbsp;and daughter-in-law honoring Jesus by being active in their church.&rdquo;<br />
After happy days in Jaime&rsquo;s home, they traveled by bus to Laredo, &nbsp;Texas, where they were met by Yban. &ldquo;Welcome to the United States,&rdquo; &nbsp;Yban greeted his parents. &ldquo;You probably found many things in Mexico &nbsp;are similar to Peru. You will have many surprises here in the States.&rdquo;<br />
The family was sleeping when they arrived in Dallas at midnight. &nbsp;Yban showed them their room. &ldquo;You will have your own private bath room.&rdquo; How can this be? Carlos wondered. Are they going outside to an &nbsp;outhouse so we can use their bathroom? Weary from travel by bus and &nbsp;car, they fell asleep, thankful to be with their son.<br />
After a morning shower, Carlos called Naomi. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn. You &nbsp;will love this. I&rsquo;ve never had a shower with so much hot water.&rdquo; While &nbsp;Naomi showered, Carlos went out to talk with his son. &ldquo;Why did you &nbsp;give us your bathroom? We didn&rsquo;t expect you to do this for us.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Yban said, &ldquo;My wife and I sleep in the master bedroom. &nbsp;We have our own bath. When visitors come, we want them to have &nbsp;privacy, so we let the children use our bathroom.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Honest? I was afraid you had to use an outhouse.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No, Papa, even the poorest people have a bathroom. Almost &nbsp;all homes are built with at least two bathrooms. Why don&rsquo;t you call &nbsp;mother and tell her breakfast is ready.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos went back to get Naomi. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re waiting for us to eat &nbsp;breakfast. This is a first-class country. Can you imagine? Yban&rsquo;s house &nbsp;has two bathrooms.&rdquo;<br />
At breakfast, Yban led out in morning worship, just as his father &nbsp;had done when he was growing up on the floating islands. Carlos and &nbsp;Naomi looked at the strange food on the table. They had never seen &nbsp;such an abundance of fruit and juice. There were several choices of &nbsp;dry cereal, including granola, and all served with cold milk. They &nbsp;didn&rsquo;t complain, but it was very different from what they were used &nbsp;to eating.<br />
133</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Later that day they discovered their son owned three cars. &ldquo;What &nbsp;kind of a country is this anyway?&rdquo; Carlos questioned. They mar veled on Sabbath when they attended a beautiful church. Each day &nbsp;in the United States brought new wonders. They were thrilled with &nbsp;their grandchildren.<br />
Back home in the highlands of Peru after their travels, Carlos sat at &nbsp;the table enjoying a meal prepared by Naomi. &ldquo;You know, dear,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;The United States has many wonderful things, but I like the plain, sim ple food you serve me the best. We are privileged to live in the Andes.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, Carlos, we are blessed,&rdquo; Naomi said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful to God &nbsp;that all our children are doing well. We are getting older, and I think &nbsp;it&rsquo;s time for us to slow down. Let&rsquo;s sell our cow. Why can&rsquo;t we rest a little &nbsp;and not work all the time? Perhaps we could get a sheep or two. We can &nbsp;dedicate our time to God and His church.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. We need rest, but one thing I want to do is fix a &nbsp;shower that will work for us. The hot showers we had in Texas were &nbsp;wonderful.&rdquo; Carlos figured out a way to put a small water tank on the &nbsp;roof where water could be warmed by the sun. He rigged up some &nbsp;pipes with a shower head, and the warmer water proved much better &nbsp;than the icy baths they had taken all their lives.<br />
Yban and Jaime had given them six thousand dollars to build a &nbsp;better home, but the frugal parents decided, &ldquo;Our simple adobe house &nbsp;meets our needs.&rdquo; They gave most of the money to their three children &nbsp;living in Peru.<br />
Looking forward to happy retirement days together, they attended &nbsp;worship services in Utawilaya. After a fellowship dinner one Sabbath &nbsp;morning, they walked to Plater&iacute;a to attend a youth choir program. &nbsp;Carlos went home to care for the sheep in the evening, but Naomi &nbsp;caught a bus to Puno to celebrate their daughter Olga&rsquo;s birthday. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll &nbsp;be back Sunday morning,&rdquo; she promised.<br />
When she had not returned by Sunday afternoon, Carlos began &nbsp;to worry. What&rsquo;s happened? he questioned. We were planning to go to &nbsp;Puno together on Monday.<br />
When Naomi had not returned by late afternoon, he put the sheep &nbsp;in their pen and started walking to the main road to catch a bus. He &nbsp;was ready to flag down a bus when his son Daniel arrived. &ldquo;Papa, we &nbsp;don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; he said, all out of breath. &ldquo;Mama&rsquo;s very sick. &nbsp;She started feeling bad on Saturday night. She&rsquo;s been in severe pain all &nbsp;day today.&rdquo;<br />
134</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Arriving in Puno, Carlos found his wife writhing in pain. She &nbsp;could hardly talk. &ldquo;Naomi,&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Will you let us take you to the &nbsp;Adventist clinic in Juliaca?&rdquo; Groaning in pain, she nodded yes. It was &nbsp;too late to go that night, so they left at dawn on Monday, accompanied &nbsp;by Daniel and their daughter Olga.&nbsp;<br />
The doctors were in surgery when they arrived, and by noon, &nbsp;Naomi still had not been seen by them. Carlos talked with his children. &nbsp;&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better go home and leave you with Mother. I left without &nbsp;getting anyone to care for our sheep. When the doctor comes, have &nbsp;him do whatever is best.&rdquo; He prayed for his wife all the way home.<br />
The doctors arrived shortly after Carlos left. After making a careful &nbsp;examination, they said, &ldquo;You really got here too late. We must rush her &nbsp;into surgery because we think she has a ruptured appendix. We&rsquo;ll do &nbsp;our best to repair the damage and clean out all the infection.&rdquo;<br />
Naomi woke up late that afternoon. &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; she wanted to &nbsp;know. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Carlos? Please tell him I want to see him.&rdquo; Daniel left for Utawilaya to find his father. &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; he said on his &nbsp;arrival. &ldquo;Mama had surgery for a ruptured appendix. She wants to see &nbsp;you. The doctors are giving her heavy doses of antibiotics to fight in fection.&rdquo; By the time Carlos found someone to watch the sheep, it was &nbsp;too late to go to the hospital that night.<br />
He arrived at Naomi&rsquo;s bedside before dawn on Tuesday morning. &nbsp;She opened her eyes when he took her hand, and she looked directly at &nbsp;him. &ldquo;God has blessed us with a wonderful life together. I love you and &nbsp;the children and Jesus.&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;Carlos, I&rsquo;m going to rest now.&rdquo; &nbsp;Her eyes closed.<br />
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday&mdash;Carlos and his children prayed. &nbsp;The doctors did everything they could, but there was no improvement. &nbsp;Naomi never talked again. She was not getting better. Carlos was by &nbsp;her side when she took her last breath on Sabbath, June 10, 2005.<br />
Tears flooded his eyes as he thought, I&rsquo;ll never forget how she looked &nbsp;at me and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to rest now.&rdquo; She knew she was going to die, &nbsp;and I know she was ready.<br />
Carlos recalled the words of Jesus when he spoke to His disciples, &nbsp;saying, &ldquo;Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up&rdquo; &nbsp;(John 11:11). It&rsquo;s true that death is like a sleep. I just can&rsquo;t wait until Jesus &nbsp;comes to wake her up.<br />
Jaime flew in from Mexico. Yban came from the United States. &nbsp;Efra&iacute;n, Olga, and Daniel had been at the hospital most of the week. At<br />
135</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">the funeral service, held in the chapel at Chullunquiani on Monday, &nbsp;Pastor Rub&eacute;n Jaimes presented a message of hope. Jaime paid a tribute &nbsp;to his mother.<br />
When the service finished, Naomi&rsquo;s four living sons acted as pall bearers, taking their mother to a vehicle waiting to take her to the cem etery. The Velasquez family, accompanied by mission workers, friends, &nbsp;and former students, walked up the steep, rocky path to the cemetery &nbsp;high on the hill behind the Adventist university.<br />
Pastor Jaimes concluded the graveside service with words of Jesus. &nbsp;&ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he &nbsp;may die, he shall live&rdquo; (John 11:25). Carlos struggled to hold back tears &nbsp;as they lowered Naomi&rsquo;s casket into the grave. He remembered words &nbsp;of Scripture: &ldquo;The days of our lives are seventy years&rdquo; (Psalm 90:10). &nbsp;Thoughts of the past flooded his mind.<br />
God has been gracious to give Naomi seventy years, and I will al ways be thankful we had fifty of those years together. She put up with so &nbsp;much during our first year of marriage when the school failed to pay my &nbsp;salary. Our years in Cusco were a struggle, but she never complained. &nbsp;Few women would have sacrificed as she did to serve the Uros on the &nbsp;floating islands of Lake Titicaca.<br />
All five living children accompanied their father to his home, but &nbsp;too soon they had to return to their work. Carlos bought gladiolus &nbsp;bulbs and planted them in memory of his wife. He cried every day for &nbsp;a month. All alone, he cared for the sheep, kept things up around his &nbsp;home, went to church, but grieved. How can I live without her? Why did &nbsp;this have to happen?&nbsp;<br />
The tomb of Chief Camacho, the Aymara Indian who befriended &nbsp;Pastor Stahl, is located within walking distance of Carlos&rsquo;s home. &nbsp;Walking by one day, Carlos had an idea. I&rsquo;m going to build a burial &nbsp;site for Naomi and me right here on our property. He finished the &nbsp;tombs and got ready to move Naomi&rsquo;s body from the university cem<br />
etery. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, Dad,&rdquo; his children said and talked him out of &nbsp;it. &ldquo;Just let Mother rest where she is. It won&rsquo;t make any difference at &nbsp;the resurrection.&rdquo;<br />
Yban knew it must be difficult for Carlos to live alone. He sent a &nbsp;message saying, &ldquo;Papa, my family and I want you to come and live with &nbsp;us in the United States. I&rsquo;ll send you a ticket.&rdquo;<br />
Arriving at his son&rsquo;s home in Dallas, Carlos stopped grieving. God &nbsp;is so good, he thought. Whoever dreamed Yban would take care of me<br />
136</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">like this. What a joy to live in a home with two bathrooms and lots of &nbsp;hot water.<br />
One day, Yban announced, &ldquo;Papa, we are going to take you to &nbsp;Michigan. You can see Andrews University. We&rsquo;ll visit Battle Creek, &nbsp;where the Adventist Church was first organized. You can see the old &nbsp;Battle Creek Sanitarium where Ferdinand Stahl worked as a nurse &nbsp;while his wife, Ana, studied nursing.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Where did Elder Stahl get his nursing education?&rdquo; Carlos asked. &ldquo;Oh, he took nursing at Madison, Wisconsin,&rdquo; Yban replied. &nbsp;Visiting historic places made Carlos happy. Whoever thought I&rsquo;d&nbsp;<br />
get to visit a city where the Stahls lived? What a blessing they were to all &nbsp;of us who live in Peru. The sacrifices they made to establish God&rsquo;s work in &nbsp;the Andes and Amazon will always be appreciated.<br />
At the Battle Creek cemetery, Carlos visited graves of Adventist &nbsp;pioneers he had often read about. Standing by the grave of Ellen White, &nbsp;he started thinking about all the Ellen G. White books he&rsquo;d read.<br />
The book Education gave me a vision of Christian education that &nbsp;guided me during all the years of my teaching ministry. I read The &nbsp;Adventist Home before marrying Naomi, and it inspired me to always &nbsp;make Christ the center of our home. We did our best to follow princi<br />
ples outlined in the book, Child Guidance. I think that is one reason all &nbsp;our children completed their education and are faithful to Jesus and His &nbsp;church today.<br />
Standing where many church pioneers are buried, Carlos silently &nbsp;prayed. &ldquo;Dear Father, thank you for faithful pioneers who determined &nbsp;to take the message of a soon-coming Savior to the entire world. Thank &nbsp;You for books like the Conflict of the Ages series that have helped me &nbsp;understand the teachings of the Bible. Thank you for dedicated people &nbsp;like Ferdinand and Ana Stahl, who, after spending time at the Battle &nbsp;Creek Sanitarium, were inspired to serve as missionaries in the Andes &nbsp;and Amazon.&rdquo;<br />
Back in Texas, Carlos kept thinking about the wonderful places &nbsp;he&rsquo;d visited. Whoever dreamed I would have such an opportunity? What &nbsp;he didn&rsquo;t know was that while he was staying in Texas, a group led by &nbsp;the Slikker family from Michigan were building a floating church for &nbsp;the Uro Indians at Lake Titicaca&rsquo;s floating islands.<br />
This man who had lived all his life in the high Andes, where the &nbsp;temperature seldom gets above fifty degrees, struggled with the Texas &nbsp;heat. He talked with his son. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m really just a little<br />
137</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Indian, but I want to go home. I can&rsquo;t spend my life in an air-condi tioned room, and it&rsquo;s too hot outside.&rdquo;<br />
He continued, &ldquo;I love the hot water. You&rsquo;ve given me the best food, &nbsp;but I&rsquo;m not used to eating like Americans. I appreciate all you&rsquo;ve done &nbsp;for me, but I think it&rsquo;s best for me to live out my life where I grew up.&rdquo;<br />
After Carlos arrived back at his home in Peru, I had the privilege &nbsp;of joining the Mission president to take Carlos to see the new floating &nbsp;church built by Maranatha Volunteers International. Tears welled up in &nbsp;his eyes when he saw the floating church for the first time. Astonished, &nbsp;he exclaimed, &ldquo;God answers prayer. The Holy Spirit has touched many &nbsp;hearts to make this possible. Give God the glory!&rdquo;<br />
He marveled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve prayed many years for this. The church is beau tiful. Praise God the Uros have a place to sing, worship, pray, and study &nbsp;God&rsquo;s Word. Not only is it a blessing to the Uros, but it&rsquo;s a witness to the &nbsp;hundreds of tourists who visit the floating islands every day.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos says, &ldquo;I thank God for giving me the privilege of starting a &nbsp;floating school for the Uros. I&rsquo;m thankful for others who followed me, &nbsp;making it possible for the floating school to continue today. I&rsquo;m thank ful to be part of a church that believes in taking the gospel &lsquo;to every &nbsp;nation, tribe, tongue, and people&rsquo; [Revelation 14:6].&rdquo;<br />
As I write this book, Carlos is in his eighties and lives alone. But, &nbsp;he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not alone. God is with me. I get exercise taking care of &nbsp;my sheep. I study, I pray, and I help the church as much as I can. I &nbsp;thank God that He will let me live long enough to take part in the one<br />
hundredth anniversary of the arrival of Pastor and Mrs. Ferdinand &nbsp;Stahl in 1911.&rdquo;<br />
God took a little Indian and used him to transform the lives of &nbsp;hundreds of Uros. Some of his students became teachers. Others are &nbsp;church workers. One went as a missionary to Bolivia.<br />
Outside his home in Utawilaya, Carlos painted a rainbow on the &nbsp;side of the place where he plans to be buried. Below the rainbow are &nbsp;these words: &ldquo;CHRIST IS COMING&mdash;BE READY.&rdquo;<br />
Jesus won&rsquo;t ask Carlos to wear a necktie. The Savior has some thing far better. He offers His saints a &ldquo;white robe,&rdquo; the robe of Christ&rsquo;s &nbsp;righteousness. Carlos can walk through heaven&rsquo;s gate wearing a white &nbsp;robe that has been washed in the blood of the Lamb.<br />

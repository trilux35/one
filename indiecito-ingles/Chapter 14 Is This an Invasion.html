<p><span style="font-size:26px;"><strong>Chapter 14: Is This an Invasion?</strong></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">The dedication of Carlos and Naomi, as they prayed for the guidance of the Holy Spirit, produced a growing transforma tion in the lives of the forgotten Uros. By the end of the first &nbsp;school year, the children&rsquo;s hair that had been dirty and matted was &nbsp;combed. Their brown bodies were clean and free from lice. Thanks to the sewing of Naomi and help from missionary wives, every student wore a uniform to school. Quick young minds picked up the Spanish language as they learned to read and write.<br />
Children who spent cold nights huddled with their families in tiny reed huts studied during the day in a floating school surrounded by the fantastic beauty of a twoand-a-half-mile-high lake. In Bible classes they learned of a Creator who made the sun, the moon, the stars, and love ly Lake Titicaca. The boys and &nbsp;girls were polite and respectful. The songs they sang inspired them with hope.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">After hundreds of years in miserable ignorance, Uro adults began &nbsp;to glimpse a better future too. Carlos talked with the men. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t &nbsp;have birth certificates or other legal documents. You&rsquo;re afraid to go&nbsp;<br />
115</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">to the city for fear of being &nbsp;detained by the police. Why &nbsp;don&rsquo;t you let me help you &nbsp;solve this problem?&rdquo; Many of the men liked &nbsp;the idea, and Carlos made an &nbsp;appointment to take them to &nbsp;a military office. They arrived on the day indicated. &nbsp;Carlos had them walk in &nbsp;formation like soldiers. He &nbsp;explained, &ldquo;When the commander comes out, I will ask &nbsp;you to stand at attention. I &nbsp;will greet the officer, and he &nbsp;will talk with you.&rdquo; At the office, Carlos in formed the secretary, saying, &nbsp;&ldquo;The Uros are here.&rdquo;<br />
The commander came &nbsp;out, and Carlos called, &ldquo;Attention!&rdquo; Immediately the men stood in formation. &ldquo;Welcome to &nbsp;Puno,&rdquo; the officer said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a great looking group. You men will do &nbsp;well serving in the army.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Carlos translated this into Aymara. When they heard the words &nbsp;&ldquo;serve in the army,&rdquo; the men disappeared. Not one stayed. They all &nbsp;escaped. The commander laughed. He accompanied Carlos to the port. &nbsp;None of the Uro men were there. Like animals fleeing from a predator, &nbsp;they had vanished. &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; Carlos asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried and tried to get these &nbsp;fearful people to apply for legal documents, and now they&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo; The kind officer understood. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to my office. I&rsquo;ll give &nbsp;you the necessary forms. You help the men fill in their personal infor mation. Then come by yourself and bring them to me.&rdquo; Persuading the men to fill out the forms proved difficult. &ldquo;The &nbsp;commander will put us in the army,&rdquo; the men objected. &ldquo;Some of us &nbsp;will be sold, and we&rsquo;ll never see our families again.&rdquo;<br />
116</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">There was another obstacle&mdash;each applicant needed a medical cer tificate. Carlos worked with the Mission to find a solution. Dr. Sanchez &nbsp;agreed to see the men and not charge anything for his services. The &nbsp;examinations went well until a nurse began to draw blood. Suddenly &nbsp;everyone believed the tales they&rsquo;d heard about pishtacos were true. &nbsp;&ldquo;What will happen to us now?&rdquo; they asked.<br />
Carlos attempted to calm their fears. He explained, &ldquo;They are not &nbsp;drawing grease from your body. They are simply going to check a little &nbsp;blood to make sure you are free from disease. Nothing will happen &nbsp;to you. When I was in the army, they often drew my blood. It doesn&rsquo;t &nbsp;cause any problem.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos patiently worked with the men to complete their forms. He &nbsp;even taught them how to sign their name. Carlos took the completed &nbsp;forms and medical certificates back to the commander. As promised, &nbsp;all who filled out the forms received their birth certificate and a legal &nbsp;document making it possible for them to vote. With these documents, &nbsp;the people could get marriage certificates.&nbsp;<br />
In the past, the Uros had secretly buried their dead at night. Now &nbsp;they could get death certificates and permission to bury their dead &nbsp;during the day, with no fear of the authorities. They had the privilege of&nbsp;<br />
117</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">voting in Peru&rsquo;s elections. With these benefits, Uros who had lost con fidence in the teacher and the school began to have confidence again. &nbsp;It took time, but more and more Uros applied for legal documents. No longer afraid, they visited stores, banks, and government offices. &nbsp;When Carlos arrived at the floating islands, there was very little &nbsp;tourism. Visitors who arrived on their own were usually chased off. A &nbsp;French couple trying to visit a nearby floating island got into serious &nbsp;trouble, and Carlos rescued them.<br />
The head of the department of tourism for Peru visited the float ing island of Torani Pata in 1964. When he discovered Uros learning &nbsp;Spanish, he decided Torani Pata with the Adventist school was the per fect place to bring tourists. Soon, people were coming from all over &nbsp;the world, and tourism at Lake Titicaca has grown ever since. Carlos &nbsp;encouraged the Uros to make souvenirs and sell them, instead of beg ging for money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">With help from ADRA, they built a large totora patio in front &nbsp;of the school. Carlos&rsquo;s students were finishing worship one morning&nbsp;<br />
118</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">when a group of teachers and students arrived from the University of &nbsp;San Augustine in Arequipa. They ran out to greet the visitors. The children all had a Bible and hymnal. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; &nbsp;one professor asked.<br />
&ldquo;We were having worship,&rdquo; the children responded.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;What do you do in worship?&rdquo; the professor wanted to know. &ldquo;We sing and read our Bibles,&rdquo; the children said.<br />
&ldquo;Read the Bible? What a waste of time!&rdquo; the university professor &nbsp;scoffed. &ldquo;You are being deceived by religious fanatics.&rdquo; At that moment, Carlos came out. His students introduced him to &nbsp;the university group. Immediately a professor asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on &nbsp;here? Your students say you teach the Bible.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, I do. It&rsquo;s a powerful book that transforms human lives and &nbsp;helps people have a purpose in life.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense. At our university, we teach the doctrines of &nbsp;Karl Marx.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; Carlos said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come into my school, &nbsp;and we can talk about this more.&rdquo;<br />
Some thirty university visitors entered the floating school. Carlos &nbsp;helped them find seats. &ldquo;We are delighted to have honored guests from &nbsp;a university,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thank you for coming to visit our Seventh-day &nbsp;Adventist floating school. We want you to feel welcome.&rdquo;<br />
A university professor stood and walked to the front. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or &nbsp;Velasquez, the people you are trying to help will never make any prog ress with the Bible. It&rsquo;s just a bunch of folklore passed down from one &nbsp;generation to the next.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Carlos interrupted. &ldquo;The Bible is the inspired &nbsp;Word of God.&rdquo;<br />
The professor from the university continued. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re ignorant. &nbsp;Unless you study Karl Marx, you don&rsquo;t know anything. We want our stu dents to progress, so we teach socialism and the doctrines of Karl Marx.&rdquo;<br />
Walking toward a bookcase, Carlos smiled. &ldquo;You say I&rsquo;m ignorant, &nbsp;because I haven&rsquo;t studied Karl Marx.&rdquo; He held up three volumes of Das &nbsp;Kapital and the Communist Manifesto. &ldquo;I want you to know, I&rsquo;ve read &nbsp;Karl Marx.&rdquo;<br />
He looked at the guest educator who had challenged him. &ldquo;You &nbsp;study Karl Marx. Have you studied the Bible?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No! Never!&rdquo;<br />
119</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve studied both,&rdquo; Carlos continued. &ldquo;I find principles in the Bible &nbsp;much superior to what Marx wrote. Please forgive me, but you&rsquo;re igno rant if you haven&rsquo;t studied the Bible.&rdquo;<br />
The group from the university remained silent, with no further &nbsp;challenge.<br />
Carlos spoke kindly. &ldquo;Our mission has an office in Arequipa &nbsp;located in Tingo. Why don&rsquo;t you visit them and find out how you can &nbsp;study the Bible?&rdquo; As the group left, one professor remarked, &ldquo;Something they&rsquo;re &nbsp;teaching in this school is making a difference. Did you notice how &nbsp;clean and polite the students are?&rdquo;<br />
This is interesting, Carlos thought. The state church accused me of &nbsp;deceiving the people. These university professors called me ignorant for &nbsp;teaching the Bible. What will be the next challenge? By 1970, the military revolution that had begun in Peru two years &nbsp;earlier was in control of the government, resulting in the erosion of de mocracy. The government took over private land, confiscated privately &nbsp;owned haciendas, and nationalized oil companies. The Puno area of &nbsp;Lake Titicaca became very much affected by the changes.<br />
The military government, desiring to build up rural communities, &nbsp;learned of successes in Puno and sent a large delegation to observe. &nbsp;Hearing that poor Uro Indians living on floating islands were savages, &nbsp;they made arrangements to visit and see for themselves. One day the steamship Ollanta, unable to navigate the shallow &nbsp;water around the floating islands, dropped anchor out in the main bay. &nbsp;People on the ship shouted, &ldquo;Come and get us.&rdquo; This is weird, Carlos &nbsp;thought. This ship normally goes back and forth between Peru and &nbsp;Bolivia. It has never stopped here before. The Uros went out to the ship &nbsp;in balsas and began picking up passengers.<br />
The visitors looked around and saw Escuela Flotante Adventista. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; one man said, &ldquo;these are missionaries. We hate people that &nbsp;bring Yankee imperialism to our country. Why did Puno permit a &nbsp;North American to come here?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re from the military. Where&rsquo;s the gringo?&rdquo; the men demanded. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the Uros answered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no gringo on this &nbsp;island.&rdquo;<br />
The Uros still had a certain fear of strangers. Hearing the word mili tary, they were stunned. Is this an invasion? Why did army people come in &nbsp;civilian clothes? Do they plan to take over our island and make us slaves?<br />
120</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Balsas kept bringing more men from the ship&mdash;almost 200 of &nbsp;them. No group this large had ever come to the Uros before. One &nbsp;of the visitors pointed to Carlos, asking, &ldquo;Is he the custodian?&rdquo; No &nbsp;one answered.<br />
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the teacher?&rdquo;<br />
When Carlos stepped forward, they asked, &ldquo;Are you the teacher?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; Carlos answered. &ldquo;My wife and I have been working for &nbsp;these people for several years now.<br />
&ldquo;Distinguished visitors,&rdquo; he said, addressing the crowd. &ldquo;Are you &nbsp;tourists? What country are you from?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No! No! We&rsquo;re Peruvians.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; Carlos exclaimed. &ldquo;Welcome! Very few Peruvians &nbsp;come here. Most of our visitors are from Europe or North America. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure you would like information about our work.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to see your school,&rdquo; they responded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re with the &nbsp;military in Cusco, and we came to see how the revolution is going in &nbsp;the Department [State] of Puno.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from Puno,&rdquo; Carlos said. &ldquo;My parents lived in a rural area, but &nbsp;they arranged for me to study at Colegio San Carlos. Later I served two &nbsp;years in the army in Puno. I&rsquo;ll be glad to share any information I can. &nbsp;Since you want to see the school, let&rsquo;s go inside to talk.&rdquo;<br />
As many as possible crowded into the classroom of the floating &nbsp;school. Carlos began to speak.<br />
&ldquo;The Uros give you a big welcome. Before telling you about Puno, &nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to share what I know about campesinos in Cusco. I worked there &nbsp;in construction from 1953 to 1956. I discovered the campesinos were &nbsp;illiterate and ignorant. It made me sad to see practically no one knew &nbsp;how to read or speak Spanish.<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably wondering why Puno is far ahead of Cusco in the &nbsp;rural areas. I&rsquo;m personally grateful for a missionary named Ferdinand &nbsp;Stahl. He and his wife started schools for the Indians. The best thing &nbsp;that ever happened to me is the years I attended Colegio Adventista del &nbsp;Lago Titicaca near Juliaca. Puno is far ahead of Cusco because we have &nbsp;Adventist schools in rural areas all around the lake. More recently, the &nbsp;government has started schools too.&rdquo;<br />
The group listened in silence.<br />
&ldquo;Many of us in this area have been educated in Adventist schools. &nbsp;We are loyal to our country and our God. Almost all in Puno know &nbsp;how to read and write. Nearly everyone has finished primary school.<br />
121</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">The majority finish secondary, and many go on to college. I&rsquo;m here &nbsp;with the Uros today because God put it in my heart to help others.&rdquo; An army general thanked Carlos for the information and asked &nbsp;for balsas to take the group back to their ship. Watching the Ollanta &nbsp;pull up anchor and sail away, the Uros relaxed, thinking, We need to &nbsp;trust Professor Velasquez and His God more. This was no invasion. The &nbsp;teacher has done much to help us.<br />

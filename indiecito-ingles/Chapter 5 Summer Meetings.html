<p><strong><span style="font-size:26px;">Chapter 5: Summer Meetings</span></strong></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">Carlos&rsquo;s hands shook as he knocked on the door of the princi pal&rsquo;s office. A pleasant voice called, &ldquo;Please come in.&rdquo;<br />
Pastor Jacobs offered Carlos a seat and then sat down be side him. &ldquo;Carlos, we are happy to have you in our school. I understand &nbsp;you and your friends have shown interest in your Bible classes and that &nbsp;you are doing well.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Sir, that&rsquo;s why I came here&mdash;I wanted to learn more about the &nbsp;Bible.&rdquo; In the back of his mind, he wondered, Why is it so urgent for me &nbsp;to see the principal? I don&rsquo;t think he called me in to say I&rsquo;m doing well in &nbsp;Bible classes.<br />
Pastor Jacobs pulled his chair a little closer to Carlos. &ldquo;At this &nbsp;school you&rsquo;ve discovered we are doing our best to follow the teachings &nbsp;of Jesus as found in the Bible. I have a question: Is it true you&rsquo;ve been &nbsp;reading palms and telling students their fortunes?&rdquo;<br />
Carlos looked down at the floor. &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s true. My parents prac ticed witchcraft and worshiped spirits. My father dedicated me to be come a witch doctor. I lived with my cousin while attending school in &nbsp;Puno, and I had friends who were interested in the spirit world and &nbsp;learned to do palm reading from them.&rdquo;<br />
Pastor Jacobs reached for his Bible. &ldquo;The Word of God speaks &nbsp;against this type of thing in many places. Let me read a couple of verses &nbsp;in Deuteronomy 18. &lsquo;Do not let your people practice fortune-telling, or &nbsp;use sorcery, or interpret omens, or engage in witchcraft, or cast spells, &nbsp;or function as mediums or psychics, or call forth the spirits of the dead. &nbsp;Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord&rsquo; [vs. 10&ndash;12, NLT].&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
Pastor Jacobs leaned forward. &ldquo;Carlos,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we want you in &nbsp;our school, but if you ever engage in palm reading again, we will have &nbsp;to ask you to leave. The Bible says fortune telling is an abomination.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Carlos said. &ldquo;I know palm reading is from the devil. I &nbsp;promise I will never do it again.&rdquo;<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;Thank you, Carlos. Let me pray with you.&rdquo;<br />
Back in the dorm, Carlos talked to his roommates. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be tell ing fortunes anymore. Pastor Jacobs showed me from the Bible that it&rsquo;s &nbsp;wrong. I know it&rsquo;s the evil spirits that do it. I&rsquo;ve decided I don&rsquo;t want &nbsp;anything more to do with the spirits. I want to forget everything I ever &nbsp;knew about them.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;One thing I like about this school,&rdquo; Roberto said. &ldquo;They seem to &nbsp;have a reason from the Bible for everything they do.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Carlos agreed. &ldquo;I like the verses in 2 Timothy that &nbsp;we learned in Bible class the other day. &lsquo;All Scripture is given by inspi ration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, &nbsp;for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, &nbsp;thoroughly equipped for every good work&rsquo; [verses 16, 17].&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
The school routine included study, work, and worship. The four &nbsp;boys enjoyed their Bible classes. On Friday evenings they attended a &nbsp;special class for new believers and learned even more. In a short time &nbsp;they knew all the gospel songs by heart and could sing as well as the &nbsp;other students.<br />
Peru is south of the equator, where seasons are the opposite of &nbsp;North America, so the school year ended in December. Roberto asked &nbsp;to be baptized on the final Sabbath and decided to spend the summer &nbsp;as a literature evangelist selling Christian books. Without making any &nbsp;decision, Carlos and the other two boys went back to Ccota to work on &nbsp;their parents&rsquo; farms.<br />
On his first Sabbath morning at home, Carlos spoke to his father. &nbsp;&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be working today. It&rsquo;s a holy day of rest. I want to take my sister &nbsp;and worship in the church at Plater&iacute;a.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; his father wanted to know.<br />
&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; Carlos explained. &ldquo;Grandma Velasquez and you taught me &nbsp;not to lie, not to steal, and not to be lazy. The Bible teaches this and &nbsp;more. Listen! Here&rsquo;s what the Bible says: &lsquo;Remember the Sabbath day, &nbsp;to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the &nbsp;seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no &nbsp;work: For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, &nbsp;and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord &nbsp;blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it&rsquo; [Exodus 20:8&ndash;11].<br />
&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; Carlos continued. &ldquo;The Incas taught us not be lazy&mdash;God&rsquo;s &nbsp;Word agrees when it says, &lsquo;Six days you shall labor and do all your &nbsp;work.&rsquo; The Bible is clear about this. It says in 2 Thessalonians 3:10, &lsquo;If<br />
44</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">anyone will not work, neither shall he eat.&rsquo; God doesn&rsquo;t want us to be &nbsp;lazy, but He also wants us to rest on His holy day. He wants us to get to &nbsp;know Him better.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;At Chullunquiani, I learned to love Jesus, and I want to live to &nbsp;please Him. Jesus said, &lsquo;If you love Me, keep My commandments&rsquo; &nbsp;[John 14:15].&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;This seems strange to me,&rdquo; Papa said. &ldquo;Since I let you go to that &nbsp;school, I won&rsquo;t stop you from going to church.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos and his sister walked across the pampa. As they arrived &nbsp;at the door of the church, Clara screamed, &ldquo;No! No! No! I&rsquo;m not &nbsp;going in.&rdquo;<br />
What should I do? Carlos thought. My sister&rsquo;s mind is full of all the &nbsp;superstitions that used to scare me. She thinks something horrible will &nbsp;happen if she goes inside an Adventist church. He took his sister by the &nbsp;hand and walked out into the pampa. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just wait here, &nbsp;and I&rsquo;ll meet you when the services are over.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos talked with his friends in the afternoon. &ldquo;Do you remem ber how it was when we first went to Chullunquiani? We didn&rsquo;t know&nbsp;<br />
45</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">anything about the Bible, and superstitious beliefs made us afraid. My &nbsp;sister got to the church door with me this morning and wouldn&rsquo;t go in. &nbsp;We need to share our faith with our families so they know what we&rsquo;ve &nbsp;learned. We can even teach them to sing.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great idea!&rdquo; Juan said. &ldquo;But where can we hold meetings?&rdquo; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk to the Ccota school and ask,&rdquo; Carlos suggested. During the week, the three young men approached the officials&nbsp;<br />
in charge of the local school. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been studying away from home,&rdquo; &nbsp;Carlos told them, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;d like to share the things we learned with &nbsp;our families. We need a place to meet. Will you let us use the school?&rdquo;<br />
The man in charge saw the boys&rsquo; enthusiasm and said, &ldquo;Since &nbsp;school is not in session, it will be fine for you to meet in the school. &nbsp;Just remember, you are responsible to keep it clean.&rdquo;<br />
Happy and relieved, the boys decided to conduct meetings &nbsp;every morning at 5:00 a.m. and again in the evening at 6:30. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll &nbsp;take turns speaking and start on Saturday night,&rdquo; Carlos suggested, &nbsp;and his friends agreed. The three boys visited every home in the &nbsp;area, inviting people to their meetings. But will people really come? they wondered.<br />
The school room filled up for the very first meeting. People came &nbsp;not only from Ccota, but from Palalla and other villages too. The boys &nbsp;had prayer, songs, a Bible message&mdash;all in the Aymara language. After &nbsp;the meeting, the boys prayed, &ldquo;Thank you, God, for bringing so many &nbsp;people to the school.&rdquo;<br />
The summer was filled with long days working on the farm and &nbsp;meetings every night and morning. At the end of it, the boys headed &nbsp;back to school. &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; Carlos said. &ldquo;God blessed us. My &nbsp;parents came the very first night, and they never missed a meeting. I &nbsp;know it&rsquo;s the work of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
Arriving back at Chullunquiani, they found Roberto unpacking &nbsp;his belongings. &ldquo;How did your summer go?&rdquo; they asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;The Lord helped me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I sold enough books to earn a &nbsp;scholarship that will pay all my board, room, and tuition for another &nbsp;year. I plan to sell Christian literature again next summer.&rdquo; &ldquo;We held meetings in a school,&rdquo; the other boys said. &ldquo;Even our par ents came, and they are beginning to understand why we are so happy &nbsp;attending a Christian school. We plan to do this every summer.&rdquo; What Carlos dreaded most happened at the end of the third year at &nbsp;Colegio Adventista del Lago Titicaca. He had a year of secondary before<br />
46</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">going to Chullunquiani, but since Peru has five years of high school, &nbsp;he still had another year to finish before he could graduate. When he &nbsp;and his friends turned eighteen, they were required to register for the &nbsp;army. What will happen now? Carlos worried. Will I be able to finish my &nbsp;studies and graduate?<br />
Hoping for the best, Roberto went to the north end of Lake &nbsp;Titicaca that summer to sell books, while Carlos, Emilio, and Juan went &nbsp;home to help their parents and held more meetings. Pastor Sosa from &nbsp;Plater&iacute;a lent them a battery-operated projector. This was their third &nbsp;summer conducting meetings, and the pictures created new interest. &nbsp;Two seniors from the Lake Titicaca Training School joined them and &nbsp;helped organize a baptismal class.<br />
A few days before that summer ended, Carlos and Juan received &nbsp;official notices to report for induction into the army in two weeks. The &nbsp;army, Carlos thought. This is what I feared most. How will I ever finish &nbsp;my education?<br />
Three summers of teaching practical Christianity to people in &nbsp;Ccota and neighboring villages had been blessed more than the boys &nbsp;could have imagined. One-hundred-twenty people, including Carlos&rsquo;s &nbsp;parents, requested baptism. Pastor Sosa came to baptize the people, ex<br />
pecting Carlos to be among the candidates. &ldquo;No, pastor, I&rsquo;m not going &nbsp;to be baptized,&rdquo; he said.<br />
His parents listened in disbelief. &ldquo;Carlos, if you&rsquo;re not baptized, &nbsp;we won&rsquo;t be baptized either,&rdquo; Emilio said, looking directly at his son. &nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You taught us how to follow Jesus. &nbsp;You showed us the evils of witchcraft and spirit worship. You helped &nbsp;us decide to stop attending fiestas and to avoid chewing coca or &nbsp;drinking alcohol. You showed us the joy found in obeying the Ten &nbsp;Commandments. Are you going to turn against God?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; Carlos said. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m leaving for the army. What if &nbsp;I&rsquo;m too weak and fail to resist the temptations I&rsquo;ll face? I don&rsquo;t want to &nbsp;make a promise to God and then break it.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos turned to Pastor Sosa. &ldquo;I promise you right now, I&rsquo;ll be bap tized as soon as I complete my two years of military service.&rdquo; His parents were confused but decided to be baptized anyway. &nbsp;Carlos was very happy to see his father and mother make their de cision to turn from the things of this world and follow Jesus Christ &nbsp;the Savior. Yet in his own mind, he was troubled. What if something &nbsp;happens to me before I complete my time in the army? John 3:5 is clear.<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom &nbsp;of God.&rdquo; The question, Will I be lost? weighed heavy on his heart.<br />

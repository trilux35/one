<p><span style="font-size:26px;"><strong>Chapter 17: The Best Book of Magic</strong></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">Although Lino Chai&ntilde;a lived only thirty miles south of Ccota, where Carlos grew up, the two men never met. Chai&ntilde;a lived &nbsp;in the city of Juli overlooking Lake Titicaca and supported his &nbsp;family by practicing witchcraft. Even though the city boasts four co lonial cathedrals built in the days of the Spanish conquistadors, the &nbsp;Aymara Indian population lived in fear and superstition. As a witch &nbsp;doctor, Chai&ntilde;a exploited this fear by practicing magic. Fifteen years before Carlos was born, Chai&ntilde;a heard that the biggest &nbsp;book of magic ever published was for sale in Puno. It will take two days &nbsp;to walk there, he thought, but I will make any sacrifice to get this book. &nbsp;A hundred-mile round trip is a long way to walk, but it will be worth it. There was no highway, just a trail traveled by animals and peo ple. Leaving as the first rays of morning light burst over the vast lake, &nbsp;Chai&ntilde;a walked past the church of Santa Cruz, a cathedral originally &nbsp;built by Jesuits. Indian stonemasons had carved a huge sun, the Inca &nbsp;god, on the front of the church. The fact that the sun, bringing warmth &nbsp;to his body and breaking the chill of the crisp morning air, had been &nbsp;created by a loving God never entered Chai&ntilde;a&rsquo;s mind. A flock of magnificent flamingos took flight as he walked along &nbsp;the lakeshore north of Juli. Their red and white wings remind me of the &nbsp;Peruvian flag, he thought. Occasionally he met young children herding &nbsp;their family&rsquo;s sheep as he trudged on toward Ilave. By mid-afternoon, &nbsp;he passed the village of Acora, and a stranger joined him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll arrive at Plater&iacute;a soon,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a house back &nbsp;against the hill where a gringo lives. He&rsquo;s a man in the daytime and an &nbsp;animal at night.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Chai&ntilde;a questioned.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Yes! People say this happens all the time.&rdquo;<br />
This is amazing! Chai&ntilde;a thought. A new idea burst in his mind. If &nbsp;I learned to do this, I could frighten people at night. As a witch doctor I&nbsp;<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">could charge to protect them from wild animals and earn a lot of money. &nbsp;They&rsquo;d never dream the animal was me.<br />
Approaching Plater&iacute;a late in the afternoon, the stranger pointed &nbsp;to the only house in the area with a metal roof. It stood alone against &nbsp;a hill. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the gringo lives,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;His name is Ferdinand &nbsp;Stahl.&rdquo;<br />
Obsessed with the idea of being able to become an animal at night, &nbsp;Chai&ntilde;a left the trail to investigate for himself. He followed a stony &nbsp;path to the Stahl home. Trembling, he knocked on the big wooden &nbsp;door. The door swung open, and a tall, strong man greeted him in his &nbsp;native Aymara.<br />
&ldquo;Kamisaraki, hermano! Why are you here?&rdquo; Pastor Stahl asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way to Puno to buy the biggest and best book of magic &nbsp;ever published,&rdquo; Chai&ntilde;a said.<br />
Pastor Stahl smiled. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to go to Puno. I have the best &nbsp;book of magic ever published right here,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Come in&mdash;I&rsquo;ll &nbsp;show it to you.&rdquo;<br />
Stahl reached out and with a big abrazo pulled the witch doctor &nbsp;into his home.<br />
&ldquo;Please have a seat at this table. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Lino Chai&ntilde;a from Juli.&rdquo;<br />
Pastor Stahl walked to a bookcase and pulled out a huge family &nbsp;Bible with lots of illustrations. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Chai&ntilde;a,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is the best &nbsp;book of magic ever published. It changes people&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;<br />
Chai&ntilde;a gulped. Does he mean it tells how to change from a man to &nbsp;an animal? he wondered.<br />
Pastor Stahl sat down beside Lino Chai&ntilde;a and began turning pages &nbsp;in the big Bible. When they got to the book of Daniel, he saw pictures &nbsp;of all kinds of strange beasts. It must be true, Chai&ntilde;a thought. This man &nbsp;must know how to turn himself into an animal at night. Reaching the &nbsp;book of Revelation, he became totally convinced. Here were pictures of &nbsp;weird animals he never imagined existed.<br />
The two men talked for a long time. Finally Pastor Stahl said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s &nbsp;late. You can&rsquo;t go to Puno tonight. Let&rsquo;s eat together, and you can spend &nbsp;the night here. My wife, Ana, is away on a trip, but she left me with a &nbsp;lot of good bread, and we can have soup.&rdquo;<br />
Later, Pastor Stahl suggested, &ldquo;Since my wife is gone, you can &nbsp;stay in our room. I&rsquo;ll sleep in the big bed, and you can have a cot over &nbsp;against the wall.&rdquo;<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Lino Chai&ntilde;a, the witch doctor from Juli, watched while Pastor &nbsp;Stahl got on his knees beside his bed and prayed. He must be asking the &nbsp;spirits to turn him into an animal, Chai&ntilde;a imagined. Instead of going &nbsp;to sleep, he stayed awake all night waiting to see Stahl turn into an &nbsp;animal. When Pastor Stahl jumped out of bed in the morning, Chai&ntilde;a &nbsp;moaned to himself, What they told me isn&rsquo;t true. He&rsquo;s still a man.<br />
Disappointed at first, but fascinated with the &ldquo;best book of magic&rdquo; &nbsp;and the strange animal pictures, Chai&ntilde;a stayed all day, studying the &nbsp;Bible with the missionary Stahl. He stayed the next day&mdash;and the next. &nbsp;He studied with Pastor Stahl every day for three weeks. Stahl gave him &nbsp;a Bible. Instead of going to Puno to buy the big book of magic, Lino &nbsp;Chai&ntilde;a went back to Juli and burned all his books of magic.<br />
After continuing to study for almost a year, Chai&ntilde;a returned to &nbsp;Plater&iacute;a and asked to be baptized by Pastor Ferdinand Stahl. Soon his &nbsp;wife and children were baptized too. A dictionary definition hardly jus tifies calling the Bible a book of magic, but Pastor Stahl was right in one &nbsp;sense. The Bible worked like magic on the hearts of the Chai&ntilde;a family &nbsp;and thousands of other Aymara Indians living around Lake Titicaca.<br />
I and my family lived at the headquarters of the Lake Titicaca &nbsp;Mission for five years, and I knew Carlos Velasquez well, but I had &nbsp;never heard of Lino Chai&ntilde;a. Soon after I transferred to Lima, the &nbsp;Mission asked me to visit mission stations on the Peren&eacute; River, where &nbsp;the Stahls worked for six years after spending nearly ten years in the &nbsp;Lake Titicaca area.<br />
One evening at a Campa village on the Peren&eacute;, the mission teacher &nbsp;and his wife invited me to join them for supper&mdash;papaya, mangos, &nbsp;bananas, and delicious bread prepared by his wife over an open fire. &nbsp;While eating in the light of a flickering candle, I asked the teacher &nbsp;where he was from and how he became a Christian.<br />
&ldquo;My father was a witch doctor in Juli,&rdquo; the son of Lino Chai&ntilde;a &nbsp;said&mdash;and then he told me the story of his father&rsquo;s conversion that you &nbsp;have just read. He added, &ldquo;We were about the only Adventist believers &nbsp;in that area, and my parents sacrificed very much to send me to Lake &nbsp;Titicaca Training College, where I studied to become a teacher. I&rsquo;m &nbsp;grateful to God for the Stahls, who brought God&rsquo;s Word to the Lake &nbsp;Titicaca region.&rdquo;<br />
Chai&ntilde;a&rsquo;s son continued, &ldquo;When the Stahls developed health prob lems in the high altitude, instead of going home, they moved here<br />
141</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">to the Peren&eacute; in the upper Amazon jungle and started gospel work &nbsp;among the Campas. It makes me very happy to be able to work where &nbsp;they worked.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Is your father still alive?&rdquo; I asked.<br />
&ldquo;Yes. My mother died, but my father lives alone, high on a moun tain above the city of Juli. He cares for his sheep and lives by selling &nbsp;wool.&rdquo; Right then, I made a decision. If I ever get a chance, I will visit &nbsp;Lino Chai&ntilde;a.<br />
After nine years in Lima, my family and I moved back to Lake &nbsp;Titicaca. We had been in Peru almost sixteen years, and still I had not &nbsp;met Lino Chai&ntilde;a. After a long weekend at a mission station near the &nbsp;border of Bolivia, we passed through Juli on our way home. I turned &nbsp;to my wife and said, &ldquo;If we are ever going to see Brother Chai&ntilde;a, we&rsquo;d &nbsp;better do it now.&rdquo;<br />
How will we ever find him? I wondered. More than ten years had &nbsp;passed since I had visited his son, and all I knew was that Lino Chai&ntilde;a &nbsp;lived up the mountain above Juli. He could be dead by now, I thought.<br />
142</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">We started asking for directions. Some said they didn&rsquo;t know, but &nbsp;most people simply pointed up the mountain. We found an animal &nbsp;trail and followed it, stopping occasionally to ask for the home of &nbsp;Lino Chai&ntilde;a. The answer was always the same. &ldquo;He lives farther up &nbsp;the mountain.&rdquo;<br />
When the trail we were trying to drive on became impassable, &nbsp;we left our car and started walking. Breathing became more difficult &nbsp;at over 14,000 feet elevation, but each time we stopped to catch our &nbsp;breath, we turned around for magnificent views of Lake Titicaca.<br />
We had walked for more than an hour when we met a man on the &nbsp;trail who said Chai&ntilde;a&rsquo;s adobe home was just a little farther. We walked &nbsp;another hour without seeing any homes at all. We stopped and talk ed with some women. One woman pointed in the distance. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where Chai&ntilde;a lives,&rdquo; she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">We kept walking, and at about 15,000 feet elevation we reached the thatched adobe house. No one around, and everything was locked up. Looking at my wife, I scowled. &ldquo;Have we come all the way up here for nothing?&rdquo; Two men came by. &ldquo;Have you seen Lino Chai&ntilde;a?&rdquo; I&nbsp;<br />
asked. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s with his sheep a little farther up the mountain. Follow the trail we just came down.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">We were getting discouraged after walking another &nbsp;half hour. &ldquo;Look, Evelyn,&rdquo; I &nbsp;said to my wife. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a &nbsp;flock of sheep.&rdquo; We walked closer. I could see an old man sitting on the ground. He had some thing in his hand&mdash;a book. Engrossed in reading, he didn&rsquo;t see us as &nbsp;we walked closer. He&rsquo;s reading the best book of magic! I wanted to shout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">143</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;Buenas tardes, Hermano Chai&ntilde;a!&rdquo;<br />
Startled, he looked up. What a joy! Former witch doctor Lino &nbsp;Chai&ntilde;a, ninety years old, was sitting on the mountainside reading the &nbsp;&ldquo;book of magic&rdquo;&mdash;his Bible&mdash;and still faithful to his Savior, sixty years &nbsp;after meeting Pastor Stahl.<br />
We sat and talked for a long time. I told him about meeting his son, &nbsp;the teacher on the Peren&eacute; in the jungle. He said, &ldquo;My wife is resting &nbsp;now, but we were grateful to God when our son became a missionary &nbsp;teacher. We were excited when he taught where the Stahls worked in &nbsp;the Amazon jungle. I thank the Lord Pastor Stahl taught me to love &nbsp;God and His great &lsquo;book of magic.&rsquo; &rdquo;<br />
It proved difficult to hold back tears as we prayed with this dear &nbsp;old man and turned to leave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been reviewing Bible teaching about &nbsp;Christ&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I pray He will come soon. I want to be with &nbsp;you, the Stahls, and all God&rsquo;s people in His kingdom.&rdquo;<br />
Walking back down the mountain, we were both thinking, The &nbsp;transforming power of God&rsquo;s Word to change human lives is amazing! I like the way one author puts it: &ldquo;The whole Bible is a revelation of &nbsp;the glory of God in Christ. Received, believed, obeyed, it is the great &nbsp;instrumentality in the transformation of character. It is the grand stim<br />
ulus, the constraining force, that quickens the physical, mental, and &nbsp;spiritual powers, and directs the life into right channels&rdquo; (The Ministry &nbsp;of Healing, 458).<br />
Reading the Bible opened the heart of Chief Camacho to receive &nbsp;missionaries Ferdinand and Ana Stahl. God used the Stahl family&rsquo;s &nbsp;large illustrated Bible to grab the attention of a witch doctor looking &nbsp;for the best book of magic. He used a priest to introduce the Bible &nbsp;to a young man who had been dedicated by his father to become a &nbsp;witch doctor. Determined to have a copy for himself, Carlos purchased &nbsp;a Bible at a market that transformed his life and inspired him to take &nbsp;heaven&rsquo;s message of love to the forgotten Uros on Lake Titicaca&rsquo;s float ing islands.&nbsp;<br />
The Bible teaches you and me how to have peace, hope, and joy, &nbsp;and be ready to live with Jesus in His everlasting kingdom.<br />

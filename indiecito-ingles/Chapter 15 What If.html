<p><span style="font-size:26px;"><strong>Chapter 15: What If?</strong></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">Carlos would never forget hearing children shout, &ldquo;Look! Look! A little Indian!&rdquo; as he rode into Puno on the back of a burro &nbsp;for the very first time. He never imagined that God could take &nbsp;a little Indian and turn him into a powerful worker for God. God used &nbsp;Carlos to help hundreds of little Indians find a better way of life, and more important&mdash;how to be ready to live in heaven.<br />
Would the Adventist floating school continue today if it were not for a little Indian who sacrificed to help others? Would it still be there if other teach<br />
ers had not followed Carlos&rsquo;s example and kept the school going? There would not be a floating church today where Uros can worship the God of heaven free from fear of spirits if Carlos had not accepted the call to &nbsp;be the first teacher for the &nbsp;floating school.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">The work of Carlos re sulted in some eighty people crowding into the school every Sabbath for worship. When my wife &nbsp;and I were back in the United States after sixteen years in Peru, he &nbsp;wrote to me, &ldquo;Dear pastor, we need a floating church.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">123</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Carlos prayed for a church, and yet decades passed, he retired, and &nbsp;there was still no church. The Mission, lacking funds, paid less atten tion to the floating islands. The Uros began to feel they were aban doned, but God did not forget them. The Lord touched the hearts &nbsp;of Tom Slikkers and his family and their local church in Holland, &nbsp;Michigan. They worked with Don Noble, president of Maranatha &nbsp;Volunteers International, along with Darrell Hardy, to make the dream &nbsp;for a church come true.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Lloyd Cleveland, the missionary who had supervised the con struction of the floating school while serving as treasurer for the Lake &nbsp;Titicaca Mission back in 1963, donated the first $10,000 toward the &nbsp;church project. The Slikkers family and their church gave much more. &nbsp;In October 2005, Tom Slikkers arrived at Lake Titicaca with a large &nbsp;group of Maranatha volunteers. By careful planning and hard work, a &nbsp;church built on twenty aluminum pontoons in less than six weeks was &nbsp;towed to the floating islands on November 11, ready for dedication the &nbsp;next day, on Sabbath, November 12, 2005.<br />
The theme for the dedication, &ldquo;Maranatha, the Lord Is Coming,&rdquo; is &nbsp;part of a chorus Carlos sang often with children attending the floating &nbsp;school. In his dedication message, Pastor Jan Paulsen, who was then&nbsp;<br />
124</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">serving as president of the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist Church, &nbsp;emphasized that the only real hope for the Uros, for Peru, and for the &nbsp;whole world is the return of Jesus. He reminded the Uros that what &nbsp;floats can drift, and he cautioned them never to drift away from Jesus &nbsp;and His Word.<br />
Would there be a floating church on Lake Titicaca today if God &nbsp;had not inspired Carlos to live with the Uros on their floating islands &nbsp;for a total of fourteen years? Only after the work of the school was &nbsp;well established did Carlos accept a call from the Mission to teach at &nbsp;another school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">One of his first students to complete primary school, Juan Santos Porcela, grandson of the witch doctor, became the first student from the Uros to gradu<br />
ate from Colegio Adventista del Titicaca. Juan was also one of the first Uros to accept Jesus and be baptized. Juan was the first Uro to go back and work for his own people. After teaching at Sicta and Amantan&iacute;, the Mission asked him to be princi pal at the floating islands school.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">125</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">By then the Adventist Mission was operating two floating schools. &nbsp;Carlos, in his kind, humble way, accepted the invitation of the Mission &nbsp;to return to the floating islands and work under the direction of his &nbsp;former student, Juan Santos Porcela. It takes a genuine Christian to be &nbsp;willing to accept leadership from someone you have led. Carlos is that &nbsp;kind of a man.&nbsp;<br />
A student missionary, Viveca-Lill Black, from the United States, &nbsp;spent time living on the floating islands and wrote: &ldquo;Carlos Velasquez &nbsp;has more vision than any other Indian I have met&mdash;more than most &nbsp;gringos too. He has a great enthusiasm for new ways and means of &nbsp;helping the Uros.&rdquo;<br />
The late Dr. Ernest Booth published an article titled, &ldquo;Carlos of &nbsp;Lake Titicaca.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;When I first met him, I was not particularly &nbsp;impressed. He seemed just an ordinary Indian schoolteacher, but my &nbsp;mind was changed in a hurry. Carlos is one of the ablest men I have &nbsp;ever met&rdquo; (These Times, December 1966).<br />
Peruvian government officials would not have paid attention to the &nbsp;needs of a forgotten tribe if changes in their way of living, resulting &nbsp;from the sacrificial lives of Carlos Velasquez and his family, had not &nbsp;caught their attention. The floating islands would not be a national park &nbsp;today if the isolated Uros had not been educated by a dedicated teacher.<br />
One has to ask, would Puno be the center of a booming tourist &nbsp;industry if Carlos had not shown the Uros the advantages of becom ing part of the nation where they lived? Many flights carrying tourists &nbsp;land in Juliaca every day. Others come by bus and train. New hotels &nbsp;have been built to care for these visitors. Every day, hundreds visit the &nbsp;floating islands.<br />
Some will say it&rsquo;s just a tourist trap, but it is a very picturesque tour ist trap. Most will go away inspired by the simple beauty and amazed at &nbsp;how the Uros have survived for centuries.<br />
How did the Uros become a world-famous attraction? There are &nbsp;many factors, of course, but an unrecognized Aymara Indian, who &nbsp;grew up determined to help others, deserves a lot of the credit. Without &nbsp;realizing it, perhaps more than anyone else, Carlos brought change not &nbsp;only to the Uros but to everyone living in the Puno area.<br />
What if Carlos had not grown up in a home where his parents &nbsp;practiced witchcraft? Would he have been able to meet the challenges &nbsp;he faced in helping superstitious Uros who worshiped spirits, looked &nbsp;to the witch doctor for counsel, and feared the outside world?<br />
126</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">If his parents had not spoken only Aymara when he was growing &nbsp;up, would he have had success in teaching children and parents who &nbsp;spoke only Aymara or Quechua to speak Spanish, which is the official &nbsp;language of their country?<br />
Carlos says, &ldquo;What if Pastor Ferdinand Stahl and his wife Ana had &nbsp;not come to the Lake Titicaca mission way back in 1911? As faithful &nbsp;missionaries, they brought education to my people. They taught us to &nbsp;live by holy principles found in the Bible. Our lives are changed forever.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos ended his teaching career in Puno, where the Lake Titicaca &nbsp;Mission headquarters is located, after thirty-six years of service for &nbsp;the Mission.<br />
Carlos asked Naomi, &ldquo;What are we going to do now? The Mission &nbsp;is giving us a small pension to live on, but I have no money to buy a &nbsp;home. We sold the land I inherited from my parents in Ccota to help &nbsp;educate our children.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;God will take care of us. He always has,&rdquo; Naomi assured her hus band. &ldquo;We still have a small piece of land I inherited from my parents.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Husband and wife worked together to build a simple adobe hut on &nbsp;Naomi&rsquo;s land in Utawilaya. Soon Carlos helped build a new church, &nbsp;where Naomi served as treasurer. She also became treasurer for the &nbsp;community. Everything they did involved sharing their faith, giving &nbsp;the gospel, and helping others improve their lives.<br />
127</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">When he learned about a special meeting being held at Plater&iacute;a, &nbsp;Carlos said, &ldquo;Naomi, we should go. The work the Stahls started at &nbsp;Plater&iacute;a, teaching God&rsquo;s Word, has changed our lives. What if the &nbsp;Stahls hadn&rsquo;t brought the good news of salvation and taught Aymaras &nbsp;a better way of life?&rdquo;<br />
After the meeting, Carlos took Naomi&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk up to the &nbsp;Stahls&rsquo; old home.&rdquo; They crossed the street in front of the church and &nbsp;followed a well-worn path up the hill toward the house. Naomi kept &nbsp;wondering, Why does Carlos want to go to the old Stahl home?<br />
They reached the gate and stopped. Carlos grinned. &ldquo;Naomi, do &nbsp;you realize it&rsquo;s more than fifty years since we met for the very first time &nbsp;right here at this gate? In a few weeks, it will be fifty years since our &nbsp;marriage.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Naomi responded. &ldquo;I was thinking about that on the way up &nbsp;here. I was leaving, and you were coming.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been bashful,&rdquo; Carlos said, &ldquo;but there was something &nbsp;about you&mdash;I just had to introduce myself. And when we shook hands &nbsp;and you smiled&mdash;it was almost like a voice spoke to me. &lsquo;Carlos, this &nbsp;woman would make a wonderful Christian wife.&rsquo; I believe God and the &nbsp;Holy Spirit put this in my mind.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; Naomi said. &ldquo;In the past, few people in the Altiplano &nbsp;even lived to be fifty years old, and God has blessed us with fifty years &nbsp;together.&rdquo; Carlos thought, What if Naomi and I hadn&rsquo;t met right here at &nbsp;the gate going into what used to be Pastor Stahl&rsquo;s house?<br />
Still standing at the gate, Carlos gave Naomi a big abrazo. &ldquo;I think &nbsp;we need to do something special. No one has ever celebrated a golden &nbsp;anniversary in the church. Why don&rsquo;t we invite our family and friends &nbsp;and have a program to rededicate our lives to each other and to God?&rdquo;<br />
As the two walked along the narrow, dusty dirt road back to &nbsp;Utawilaya, Carlos said, &ldquo;God has blessed far more than I thought pos sible. He gave us six children, and they all became professionals. Most &nbsp;important, they are all Christians and faithful to Jesus and His church. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ve been a wonderful mother, Naomi, and I&rsquo;m blessed to have you &nbsp;as my wife.&rdquo;<br />
The Velasquez family had a right to be proud of their children, &nbsp;who grew up living among the Uros on the floating islands of Lake &nbsp;Titicaca. Their oldest, Edgar, became an engineer. Yban graduated &nbsp;from medicine at Montemorelos University and moved to the United &nbsp;States, where his children attended Andrews University. Jaime became<br />
128</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">a physician working in Mexico. Olga went to be a nurse in Puno. &nbsp;Efra&iacute;n got a job teaching engineering at the Adventist university at &nbsp;Chullunquiani. The youngest, Daniel, a certified public accountant, &nbsp;worked for years in the education department of the Lake Titicaca &nbsp;Mission and then transferred to Cusco, where he served the education &nbsp;department for a brand new Mission.<br />
Reaching home, Carlos said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing. There&rsquo;s no possible way &nbsp;we could have educated six children. Not with the kind of salary I&rsquo;ve &nbsp;earned through the years. God did it. You&rsquo;ve been a very frugal wife, &nbsp;Naomi, and that&rsquo;s helped a lot.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;God has worked miracles,&rdquo; Naomi added, &ldquo;but He has also al lowed heartaches to come our way. Remember when Yban almost &nbsp;drowned. We prayed, and he survived. Edgar injured his back in an ac cident. We asked God for healing, but instead of getting better he grew &nbsp;worse.&rdquo; About a year later, the couple received the saddest news of their &nbsp;lives. Edgar had died at the Adventist clinic in Juliaca.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to believe it,&rdquo; Naomi said. &ldquo;I asked, &lsquo;Why? How can &nbsp;this be?&rsquo; I agonized over it.&rdquo; When he died, Edgar had just been hired &nbsp;as supervisor for a German company, drilling wells to help poor fami lies living in rural areas of Peru to have fresh water.<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve struggled with this too,&rdquo; Carlos said, &ldquo;but thank God our son &nbsp;was a Christian. I take courage from the Bible promise, &lsquo;All things work &nbsp;together for good to those who love God&rsquo; [Romans 8:28]. We can still &nbsp;be grateful for five living children and their families. We truly serve a &nbsp;marvelous God.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos squeezed Naomi&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wondered where I &nbsp;would be today if you hadn&rsquo;t married me.&rdquo; They spent the rest of the &nbsp;evening writing to their children about their anniversary plans. At least &nbsp;we can invite them, Carlos thought. I don&rsquo;t think Yban and Jaime will &nbsp;come all the way from North America. It&rsquo;s too far, and travel is expensive.<br />

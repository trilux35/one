<p><strong><span style="font-size:26px;">Chapter 13: Miracle Cross</span></strong></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">Men drew in their nets after fishing for hours in the dark est part of a May night. They unloaded the fish into their balsas, folded the nets, and watched the morning sun rise &nbsp;slowly over distant hills as they headed back to Torani Pata. One &nbsp;Uro fisherman pointed to something floating in the water. Another, &nbsp;getting closer, managed to pull it into the boat&mdash;an attractive &nbsp;wooden cross.<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a miracle!&rdquo; they shouted. &ldquo;How could such a beautiful cross &nbsp;come right out of the lake?&rdquo; Back on their floating island that eve ning, they took it into a hut, burned incense, and consulted the spirits. &nbsp;&ldquo;Santa Cruz,&rdquo; they asked. &ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo;<br />
They waited in silence, hearing only the sound of wind blow ing outside the hut. And then a strange voice spoke. &ldquo;I came from &nbsp;Copacabana in Bolivia. I dove into the lake near the Island of the Sun. I &nbsp;dove in again at La Mota near Chucuito. I dove in again near the Uros. &nbsp;Thank you for finding me. Please plan a fiesta in my honor.&rdquo;<br />
Reverently they wrapped the cross in cloth, covered it with a veil, &nbsp;and lit candles. &ldquo;Truly this is a miracle,&rdquo; they declared. &ldquo;From now on &nbsp;we will celebrate La Cruz de Mayo as a day of fiesta because we found &nbsp;the cross in the month of May.&rdquo;<br />
The next morning a young man who grew up in Capachica visited &nbsp;the island. He had left his aging parents and gone to work in Arequipa. &nbsp;When his father died, the mother sent her son an urgent message. &nbsp;&ldquo;Please come home!&rdquo;<br />
Carrying a lovely wooden cross, He arrived in Puno by train. He &nbsp;walked to the port and found a boat headed for Capachica. Carefully, &nbsp;he placed the cross in the bow of the boat where it would be secure &nbsp;during the all-night voyage. A storm rose and waves washed over the &nbsp;bow. Before leaving the sail boat in the morning, the young man went &nbsp;to pick up the cross he thought was secured well, but it was gone.<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">If anyone finds it, the young man thought, it will be the Uro fisher men. After spending a day with his mother, he borrowed a balsa and &nbsp;headed for the floating islands. &ldquo;Has anyone seen a wooden cross?&rdquo; &nbsp;he asked.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; the Uros answered, &ldquo;but we have a miracle cross.&rdquo; &ldquo;Truly? May I see it?&rdquo; the owner of the lost cross asked. At first they were reluctant, but finally they led him to the little reed hut where they were keeping it. He watched as they unwrapped &nbsp;the cross. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be deceived,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This cross is no miracle! I &nbsp;bought it in Arequipa to put on my father&rsquo;s grave. It washed overboard &nbsp;during the night while I sailed to Capachica.&rdquo;<br />
Nothing the owner of the cross said made any impression. &nbsp;Convinced by demons when they contacted the spirits that the cross &nbsp;had come to them, they insisted, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a miracle cross from Copacabana. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t have it. This holy cross dove into the lake three times to get &nbsp;here.&rdquo; No persuasion from the young man could convince the fishermen that he was the cross&rsquo;s rightful owner. Finally he offered to buy &nbsp;it back. The Uro believers in witchcraft refused to sell the cross. The &nbsp;disappointed young man paddled away, marveling, How can people be &nbsp;so deceived by the devil&rsquo;s lies?<br />
After hearing this story, Carlos recalled how his own parents at tended Mass and practiced witchcraft. Each day, he decided, I will pray &nbsp;for wisdom to be able to teach the people about a real Jesus who died on &nbsp;the cross to save them from sin and help them find a better way of life.<br />
During the first month after the school&rsquo;s arrival, a family from an other island came to visit Carlos on a Sabbath afternoon. With great &nbsp;respect they said, &ldquo;Professor, we want you to write a letter to the priest &nbsp;in Puno, inviting him to come in May to conduct Mass for La Cruz de &nbsp;Mayo fiesta.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos explained, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Seventh-day Adventist teacher. What if an &nbsp;Adventist came to your fiesta?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No, professor, we want the priest. We don&rsquo;t know how to write. &nbsp;Last year a priest came after the fiesta was all over. We want him to &nbsp;come on the exact day. Please write a letter to the priest for us. If we &nbsp;send a message with someone, he will not believe us.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos smiled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an Adventist teacher. How would you like me &nbsp;to come?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Could you conduct Mass for us?&rdquo; they asked.<br />
108</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t conduct Mass, but we could sing and pray, and I could &nbsp;tell you about Jesus and the cross.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Please, please write a letter for us,&rdquo; they insisted.<br />
Carlos explained, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to teach school and help your children &nbsp;learn to read and write, but I&rsquo;m not authorized to invite a priest to &nbsp;come and say Mass.&rdquo;<br />
The family left and decided to go to Puno and visit the priest &nbsp;themselves. When he did not give them a firm answer to their request, &nbsp;they said, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t come, we will invite the Adventist teacher.&rdquo; &nbsp;Immediately the priest promised to conduct Mass for their fiesta.<br />
The priest came as promised, but he hurried through Mass and &nbsp;left without accepting their invitation to eat with them. Weeks passed, &nbsp;and the wife of the man who asked Carlos to write to the priest talked &nbsp;to her husband, saying, &ldquo;We made a mistake by inviting the priest. We &nbsp;should become Adventistas.&rdquo;<br />
When the floating school first arrived, people had warned, &ldquo;This is &nbsp;a dangerous place. Lightning will strike and destroy your school. You &nbsp;need to have a priest come and conduct Mass so your school will be safe.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos responded, &ldquo;Our school is dedicated to God. We will trust &nbsp;in Him to keep us safe.&rdquo; He remembered how he had worried about &nbsp;lightning before moving to the floating islands. He was encouraged &nbsp;when he learned that normally one is safe inside a metal building. No &nbsp;building is 100-percent safe, but the safest place during a lightning&nbsp;<br />
109</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">storm is inside a building or an automobile. Being inside the float ing school was something like being inside the cabin of a boat. Carlos &nbsp;often thanked God that they were never once struck by lightning.<br />
Wind proved a greater threat. The Uros always built their float ing islands back among the totora reeds, away from the open lake. A &nbsp;south wind would never cause a problem as it could only blow them &nbsp;back further into the reeds. North winds were rare but greatly feared, &nbsp;because they could blow the islands into the main lake.&nbsp;<br />
Carlos and Naomi were in bed and their children were sleeping on &nbsp;the floor one night when the wind began to howl around the school. &nbsp;Soon waves began breaking against the side of the school. Carlos woke &nbsp;up. &ldquo;Naomi, it&rsquo;s a north wind,&rdquo; he said anxiously. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re in for &nbsp;trouble tonight. The island is breaking away from the reeds and blow<br />
ing up against the school.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
He quickly dressed and checked the poles they had driven into the &nbsp;lake bottom as anchors. &ldquo;The poles are firm, and the ropes are holding,&rdquo; &nbsp;he assured his wife. The Uros, fearful of losing their balsas, came and &nbsp;tied them up to the school. Carlos cautioned, &ldquo;Too many balsas tied to &nbsp;the school in a storm like this may cause our anchor poles to break.&rdquo;<br />
As the wind increased, reed huts began to topple. Fearing the an chor poles would snap, Carlos prayed earnestly. &ldquo;Lord, please keep the &nbsp;anchor poles from breaking. Please protect the people whose homes &nbsp;are blowing down. We leave our lives in Your hands.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
He remembered how Christ&rsquo;s disciples feared for their lives during &nbsp;a night wind storm on a lake. Jesus stood up and simply said, &ldquo;Peace, &nbsp;be still!&rdquo; The Bible adds, &ldquo;And the wind ceased and there was a great &nbsp;calm&rdquo; (Mark 4:39).<br />
Immediately after Carlos prayed, the winds slowly began to die &nbsp;down. By morning the lake was quiet. The people were able to set up &nbsp;their totora reed huts again. &ldquo;We have a lot to be thankful for,&rdquo; Carlos &nbsp;said. &ldquo;No one was injured. Not a single balsa boat was lost. The poles &nbsp;anchoring the school held firm. Our God is a powerful God, and He &nbsp;protected us.&rdquo;<br />
Another &ldquo;wind&rdquo; would challenge Carlos&rsquo;s work for the Uros. &nbsp;Scripture says that we should not be &ldquo;carried about with every wind of &nbsp;doctrine&rdquo; (Ephesians 4:14). Padre Aldo, an Italian priest who served as &nbsp;secretary to the Bishop of Puno, visited the school. Carlos had met him &nbsp;while attending Mass as a student at Colegio San Carlos.<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a campesino. What are you doing here?&rdquo; the padre asked.<br />
110</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the teacher for the Adventist school.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Teacher? You came here to deceive these people. How did you &nbsp;get here?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sent by the Lake Titicaca Mission.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;ve been deceived by American gringos. You have no &nbsp;business coming here to take advantage of these poor people! Why are &nbsp;you a Protestant?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; Carlos replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Protestant because my father was &nbsp;a Catholic.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;The priest charged my parents an exorbitant amount to conduct &nbsp;Mass. After my father gave the priest all the money he had, he went &nbsp;out and mortgaged our land in order to pay the required sum. Looking &nbsp;back, what bothers me the most is that nothing was done to help my &nbsp;parents live better lives. When the Adventist missionaries came, they &nbsp;taught us to love Jesus and keep His commandments. They started &nbsp;schools and showed us a better way of life.&rdquo;<br />
The padre looked at Carlos in disgust. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a demon,&rdquo; he &nbsp;shouted.<br />
&ldquo;No! What I have is a desire to help these people live happy lives &nbsp;on earth and be ready for eternal life in heaven. Because they are poor &nbsp;and don&rsquo;t have money to pay, they&rsquo;ve been overlooked.&rdquo;<br />
After remaining silent for a moment, the padre said, &ldquo;I want you &nbsp;to announce to all the people that I&rsquo;ll be here Sunday morning to &nbsp;conduct Mass.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Carlos said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be able to do that.&rdquo;<br />
The padre found a man who took him to all the islands, and he in vited the people to come to the school for a Mass on Sunday. What shall &nbsp;I do? Carlos wondered. With no way to communicate with the Mission, &nbsp;he and his wife prayed, asking for divine guidance. After counseling to gether, they decided that Carlos would face the priest alone on Sunday. &nbsp;His wife and children would stay inside the school and pray.<br />
The Uro men had all returned from fishing on Sunday morning &nbsp;when the Velasquez family heard the sound of a motor. &ldquo;Please pray,&rdquo; &nbsp;Carlos reminded his family as he walked out of the floating school. &nbsp;He greeted three European tourists, followed by Padre Aldo and his &nbsp;assistant.<br />
&ldquo;Please lend me a box to set up my things for the Mass,&rdquo; the priest &nbsp;requested.<br />
111</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Carlos got a box and suggested, &ldquo;You can set it up on our floating &nbsp;patio.&rdquo;<br />
Students came and sat down on the reeds. Adults came too but &nbsp;stayed in their balsas. The padre&rsquo;s assistant passed out a small brochure. &nbsp;&ldquo;Please turn to page seventeen,&rdquo; Padre Aldo announced. &ldquo;Next, please &nbsp;turn to page three.&rdquo; The adults stared at each other. Only speaking &nbsp;Aymara, they had no idea what was being said.<br />
No one paid attention to the priest, who spoke only Spanish. Padre Aldo realized things were not going well and hurried to finish. The &nbsp;tourists who spoke Spanish talked with Carlos. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t understand &nbsp;what&rsquo;s going on, but it seems like this Mass is a complete failure.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big advantage to speak the language of the &nbsp;people. We&rsquo;ve just started this mission school, and one of our goals is &nbsp;to teach the people Spanish so they can read the Bible.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We congratulate you for what you are doing,&rdquo; the visitors said. &ldquo;Are you Catholics?&rdquo; Carlos asked.<br />
&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re Protestants. We appreciate your courage to come and &nbsp;live in a place like this.&rdquo;<br />
The priest finished and called Carlos. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Velasquez! Go to the &nbsp;boat and get the bread I brought. I&rsquo;m leaving it with you.&rdquo; Carlos carried five sacks full of bread to the school. Naomi placed &nbsp;a big white cloth on the floor, and they placed the bread on it. The boat &nbsp;with the tourists and the priest left, but the people who had come in &nbsp;balsas were still hanging around. Carlos called out, &ldquo;Come into the &nbsp;school. We want to give you bread.&rdquo;<br />
Many Uros who had been fearful of going inside the school went &nbsp;in and sat on the floor around the bread. With a twinkle in his eye, &nbsp;Carlos said, &ldquo;We will have another hour of Misa.&rdquo;<br />
He showed the people his Bible and talked about how Jesus came &nbsp;to give us the bread of life. The Uros nodded in agreement and smiled. &nbsp;They asked many questions, and Carlos gave answers straight from the &nbsp;Word of God.<br />
Finally Carlos said, &ldquo;We are here to help you, but we need your &nbsp;help too. God wants you to have clean bodies. That&rsquo;s why we have been &nbsp;teaching the children to take baths. We need to keep our houses clean. &nbsp;Our bodies belong to Jesus, and we need to give them the best possible &nbsp;care. You will live longer and have better health if you avoid the use of &nbsp;alcohol and coca. And we need your cooperation to make the school&rsquo;s &nbsp;floating patio much larger.&rdquo;<br />
112</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; The people all agreed.<br />
Naomi began handing out bread. Thanks to Padre Aldo, everyone &nbsp;left the school that day with bread. Alone with his family, Carlos said, &nbsp;&ldquo;I really worried about what would happen today, but we prayed, and &nbsp;God has worked it out for good. The people were more responsive than &nbsp;they have ever been. I believe the Holy Spirit is working.&rdquo;<br />
After many months, Carlos received another challenge from the state sponsored church. A group of nuns from Puno planned to take over the work of educating the Uros. They arrived at the floating school along with the director of education for the state of Puno and a Catholic priest.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Without asking permis sion, they used the school &nbsp;patio to conduct Mass. Before leaving, the director for education approached Carlos. Holding up a crucifix, he said, &nbsp;&ldquo;This is a gift for the school. It won&rsquo;t cost you anything, and you must &nbsp;put it up in the window of the school.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; Carlos said politely. &ldquo;I cannot accept your gift. &nbsp;This school belongs to the Lake Titicaca Mission. You will have to take &nbsp;your crucifix to the Mission, and if it is accepted, they will ask me to &nbsp;display it in our school.&rdquo; The visiting group remained silent and left.<br />
Carlos wondered, What will they do next? He didn&rsquo;t have to wait &nbsp;long. Another priest came in his own boat. Carlos invited him into &nbsp;the floating school and gave him a seat. &ldquo;Professor,&rdquo; the priest began. &nbsp;&ldquo;You are leading the Uros astray. I&rsquo;ve studied theology for twenty years. &nbsp;Have you studied theology?&rdquo;<br />
Carlos listened and prayed as the priest continued. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just an &nbsp;ignorant campesino, and you think you can teach Bible doctrine. You&rsquo;re &nbsp;deceiving the Uros.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to deceive anyone,&rdquo; Carlos replied.<br />
&ldquo;Yes, you are. You&rsquo;ve sold out to the Adventistas. They&rsquo;re taking &nbsp;advantage of you.&rdquo;<br />
113</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like you say,&rdquo; Carlos responded. &ldquo;I have the Holy Bible. It&rsquo;s &nbsp;about faith in Jesus and following the instructions in His Word.&rdquo; &ldquo;But, professor, you&rsquo;re not teaching the Word. You teach all kinds &nbsp;of crazy things that are not biblical.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Well, for example, you tell the people they need to pay tithe.&rdquo; Carlos handed the priest a Bible. &ldquo;This is not our Bible,&rdquo; he objected. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Carlos said. He handed the priest a Catholic version of the Holy Bible. &ldquo;It teaches that we are robbing God if we don&rsquo;t &nbsp;give our tithe. If you can show me a text that tells us not to pay tithe, I &nbsp;will stop giving tithe.&rdquo;<br />
Ignoring the request for a Bible verse, the priest continued. &ldquo;You &nbsp;are telling people not to eat pork. Where in the Bible does it say not to &nbsp;eat flesh of swine?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; Carlos said. &ldquo;Let me see the Bible.&rdquo; He planned to turn &nbsp;to Leviticus 16, but as he prayed silently, the Bible opened to Isaiah 66, &nbsp;and his eyes fell on verse seventeen. &ldquo;Listen to what this says: &lsquo;They that &nbsp;did eat swine&rsquo;s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse: they shall &nbsp;be consumed together, saith the Lord&rsquo; &rdquo; [Isaias 66:17, Douay Version].&nbsp;<br />
The priest began to tremble. He grabbed the Catholic Bible out &nbsp;of Carlos&rsquo;s hands and threw it on the floor. Astonished, Carlos said, &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been calling me ignorant. Where is your twenty years of theol ogy?&rdquo; He put his hand on the priest&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;How can any Christian &nbsp;throw the Word of God on the floor? This is ignorance of the power of &nbsp;God and the respect we owe to His Word.&rdquo;<br />
The priest stood speechless. Carlos stepped forward and picked &nbsp;up the Bible. Unable to speak, the priest hurried to his boat and left. &nbsp;This is another miracle, Carlos thought. I hadn&rsquo;t even thought about &nbsp;Isaiah 66:17, and the Catholic Bible opened right to that text. I must &nbsp;pray that the priest will see the truth in God&rsquo;s Word. Carlos felt encouraged. God will not allow Satan to destroy His work of giving the gospel &nbsp;truth to the Uros.<br />
He marveled at how the Uros had become fascinated with a &nbsp;wooden cross found floating in the lake. Like my parents, he thought, &nbsp;they&rsquo;ve been deceived by evil spirits. He prayed, &ldquo;Loving Lord, help us &nbsp;lead the people to know the Jesus who died on the cross. Help them &nbsp;want to love and obey Him. Help the Uros discover the true miracle of &nbsp;the cross.&rdquo; He thought, The real miracle is that &ldquo;The blood of Jesus Christ &nbsp;His Son cleanses us from all sin&rdquo; [1 John 1:7].<br />

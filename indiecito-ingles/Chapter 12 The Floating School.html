<p><strong><span style="font-size:26px;">Chapter 12: The Floating School</span></strong></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">Aboat is coming! A boat is coming!&rdquo; Uros shouted as they ran to join Professor Velasquez. No one could see it, but they &nbsp;heard the roar of a powerful engine. The captain of the port of &nbsp;Puno had volunteered to use a navy patrol boat to tow the new float ing school to the island of Torani Pata, where children had grown up &nbsp;for centuries without a school. The arrival of a floating school in April &nbsp;1963 would change their lives forever.<br />
The captain carefully maneuvered through the narrow channel &nbsp;surrounded by totora reeds. The launch carrying Mission admin istrators and their families followed close behind. &ldquo;I see it! I see it!&rdquo; &nbsp;Uro children screamed. Carlos directed the boat to the site where the &nbsp;school would be anchored. The bright corrugated-metal roof gleamed &nbsp;in the late morning sun.<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Carlos was first to step inside the new building. Walking across &nbsp;the rough wood floor, he exclaimed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to step on something &nbsp;solid after walking on spongy totora for a month.&rdquo; The missionaries &nbsp;worked to get the school properly anchored before leaving. They left &nbsp;a crew headed by Roberto Coila to install the metal siding, windows, &nbsp;and doors.&nbsp;<br />
Outdoor classes continued while the crew worked to finish the &nbsp;construction. When the work was completed, the mission launch re turned, bringing Carlos&rsquo;s wife, Naomi, his three children, and their &nbsp;few belongings. He helped his family out of the boat. Their new home &nbsp;would be a small room on one end of the school. Husband and wife &nbsp;worked together to set up a bed&mdash;their only piece of furniture. No &nbsp;chairs, no table, no dresser, no drawers. The children slept on the floor.<br />
The one-burner kerosene primus they had failed to sell in Cusco &nbsp;served for cooking. To eat, they all sat in a circle on the floor. As a boy, &nbsp;Carlos had grown up in a home where everyone ate with their hands. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re blessed, he thought. We each have a plate and a spoon. No one &nbsp;complained that they didn&rsquo;t have a fork or a knife.<br />
The family struggled to get used to a new diet. Fish for break fast. Fish for dinner. Fish for supper. Naomi had brought a bag full of&nbsp;<br />
94</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">chu&ntilde;os that provided a little variety. Later, ADRA sent flour and oil, &nbsp;which enhanced their diet. Carlos never did find an egg big enough to &nbsp;fill a basket, but like the Uros, he learned to hunt for bird eggs that they &nbsp;boiled. For salad, they ate the fresh roots of totora.<br />
The Lake Titicaca Mission, supported by local people and occa sional subsidies from church headquarters in the United States, found it &nbsp;difficult to pay teachers what they deserved. This was especially true for &nbsp;the floating school, where students paid no tuition. Carlos and Naomi &nbsp;never complained. They always said, &ldquo;God sent us here, and we will do &nbsp;our best.&rdquo;<br />
The family&rsquo;s clothing and books were stored in boxes. They did not &nbsp;own a radio, and Carlos couldn&rsquo;t even afford a watch. Curious Uros &nbsp;became fascinated with their one luxury&mdash;a windup alarm clock. All &nbsp;day long&mdash;tick, tick, tick. The Uros had never seen anything like it. They &nbsp;would point and say, &ldquo;It has a spirit.&rdquo;<br />
Witch doctors for centuries had taught fear of spirits to the Uros. &nbsp;They used this fear to gain control over people&rsquo;s lives. As the highest &nbsp;authority, the witch doctor counseled with people about the most in timate details of life. The primitive Uros held no legal documents&mdash;no &nbsp;birth certificate, no marriage license, no death certificate, and no docu ment to show they existed.<br />
When young people wanted to marry, they went to the witch doc tor. This is abusive and disgusting, Carlos thought when he learned that &nbsp;part of the marriage ceremony often involved the witch doctor dem onstrating sex to the bride while the groom watched. He would have &nbsp;found many things hard to believe if he had not grown up in a home &nbsp;where witchcraft was practiced. He knew firsthand that the devil is be hind much of what goes on.<br />
The old blind witch doctor, Emilio Porcela, had not shown himself, &nbsp;even though Carlos kept hearing about him. He lived on another is land but served as leader for all the floating islands. After the arrival of &nbsp;the school, the witch doctor became concerned, perhaps thinking, This &nbsp;teacher with a building will steal my influence.<br />
After his students left for home one afternoon, Carlos found Emilio &nbsp;Porcela waiting on the island outside the school. &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; &nbsp;the witch doctor demanded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come to earn lots of money!&rdquo; &nbsp;he declared.<br />
If only he knew the truth, Carlos thought. It&rsquo;s really tough to support &nbsp;a family with children on the equivalent of $15.00 a month I receive from<br />
95</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">----</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">the Mission. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; Carlos said kindly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to help your children &nbsp;learn to read and write. My wife and I want to help families live better &nbsp;lives. We want everyone to learn to speak Spanish. It&rsquo;s the language of &nbsp;our country.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Velasquez, we don&rsquo;t need anyone to help us. My people &nbsp;have lived on the lake for many generations. We don&rsquo;t need outsiders &nbsp;to teach us how to live.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; Carlos responded. &ldquo;My Aymara ancestors lived in filth and &nbsp;misery for hundreds of years. Then a missionary couple by the name &nbsp;of Ferdinand and Ana Stahl arrived in the Altiplano and showed us a &nbsp;new way of life. They started schools and taught us how to have better &nbsp;health. This is what I want to do for the Uros.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Fernando Stahl!&rdquo; the witch doctor exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard there&rsquo;s a &nbsp;school with the name Fernando Stahl in Plater&iacute;a.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;True,&rdquo; Carlos said. &ldquo;I served as principal of Colegio Fernando &nbsp;Stahl for one year. Stahl is a good name, but I want you to know I &nbsp;like your name&mdash;Emilio Porcela. My father&rsquo;s name is Emilio. You may &nbsp;not remember, but I met you when you came to Puno. You visited the &nbsp;home of the owner of the room where my cousin and I stayed while &nbsp;attending school in Puno. You came at night.<br />
96</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;I was curious because my parents practiced witchcraft and want ed me to become a witch doctor. You contacted the spirits, asking them &nbsp;to bless a man who was starting a new business.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Oh, oh, yes,&rdquo; the witch doctor said. &ldquo;That was many years ago. The &nbsp;man paid a large sum of money, and I held the ceremony at night for &nbsp;fear of getting into trouble with the authorities.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Carlos agreed. &ldquo;It was a long time ago. I was just a young boy &nbsp;and never dreamed I&rsquo;d ever see you again. I&rsquo;m glad you are here, and I &nbsp;want to thank you for telling your people not to harm me. My wife has &nbsp;our evening meal ready. Why don&rsquo;t you come inside and eat with me?&rdquo;<br />
They sat on the floor around the big kettle. Naomi handed their &nbsp;guest a plate and a spoon. Carlos explained, &ldquo;We believe in the God &nbsp;of heaven. He made us. He made Lake Titicaca. He made everything. &nbsp;Before we eat, we like to thank Him.&rdquo; Carlos and his family bowed their &nbsp;heads for grace.<br />
&ldquo;Father in heaven,&rdquo; Carlos prayed. &ldquo;We thank You for all You do for &nbsp;us. Please bless our food and give us health and strength to serve You. In &nbsp;Jesus&rsquo; name, amen.&rdquo; While they were eating together, the witch doctor&nbsp;<br />
learned more about Carlos and the school. A few days later his grand son, a bright boy named Juan Santos Porcela, enrolled in the school. &nbsp;Juan asked many questions. Bible stories especially fascinated him.<br />
97</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">More new students came to the school, yet many parents con tinued to spread false rumors. Some of the illiterate Uros seemed &nbsp;more concerned with gringos and pishtacos than taking advantage of &nbsp;the opportunity to educate their children. &ldquo;The teacher is a gringo,&rdquo; &nbsp;they insisted. &ldquo;Just wait! He seems kind, and children like him, but &nbsp;our children will suddenly vanish. Se&ntilde;or Velasquez will get rich sell ing grease from our children&rsquo;s bodies. We must stop him before it&rsquo;s &nbsp;too late.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos shared his concerns with Naomi. &ldquo;I know they didn&rsquo;t want &nbsp;a school, but calling us gringos makes no sense,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to &nbsp;convince them that we are one of them. The Uros have intermarried &nbsp;with Quechuas and Aymaras. Why can&rsquo;t they accept us for what we &nbsp;really are? The children in Puno were right when they called me a &lsquo;little &nbsp;Indian.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m an Indian just like them.&rdquo;<br />
Naomi suggested, &ldquo;Perhaps the Uros need to meet your parents.&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a wonderful idea!&rdquo; Carlos agreed.<br />
He rented a sailboat, and with about thirty students and twenty in terested adults, sailed across the blue waters of Lake Titicaca&rsquo;s Chucuito &nbsp;Bay. Leaving the boat at the edge of the lake, they walked along a rocky &nbsp;trail to Ccota. Carlos presented his mother, Ignacia. She smiled and &nbsp;declared, &ldquo;This is my son.&rdquo; He introduced his father. Emilio greeted the &nbsp;guests and, turning back to Carlos, said, &ldquo;This is my son.&rdquo;<br />
After introducing Carlos&rsquo;s brothers and sister, the Velasquez fam ily served food to their Uro guests. Later that afternoon, as the Uros &nbsp;sailed back to Torani Pata, they talked about what they had seen. &ldquo;We &nbsp;thought he painted his skin to deceive us, but he looks just like his &nbsp;family. He can&rsquo;t be a pishtaco.&rdquo; No one ever called Carlos gringo again.<br />
Although the people began to show more confidence, it would &nbsp;take years for the Uros to believe they were doing the right thing in let ting a teacher from the outside bring a floating school to their village. &nbsp;Parents approached Carlos with questions. &ldquo;Why are you teaching our &nbsp;children not to drink alcohol or chew coca?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Alcohol and coca harm the body,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;We want you to live &nbsp;long, happy lives.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;But, Professor Velasquez,&rdquo; they argued. &ldquo;We live on water, not &nbsp;land. To spend your life living on water you must use alcohol. Without &nbsp;it you will die. Coca is necessary too!&rdquo;<br />
At harvest time, the Uros invited Carlos and his family to join &nbsp;them in a trip to the big island of Amantan&iacute;. After beginning the trip<br />
98</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">in a large boat, they all started drinking. They handed a glass of alcohol &nbsp;to Carlos. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t drink.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t drink, you&rsquo;ll get sick. You&rsquo;ve got to drink a little glass full, at least.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos stood firm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to drink!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t drink, you and your wife will get very sick.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Carlos countered. &ldquo;If I get sick, if my wife gets sick, if &nbsp;my children get sick, then you have a point. Let&rsquo;s see how my family &nbsp;does without alcohol during this trip.&rdquo;<br />
To reach the big island of Amantan&iacute;, they sailed all night. By &nbsp;morning the Uros were all sick, but Carlos, his wife, and children felt &nbsp;fine. No one in his family got sick. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said to the Uros, &ldquo;ev erything you&rsquo;ve said about the benefits of alcohol and coca has proved &nbsp;false. You drank alcohol and chewed coca, and you&rsquo;re all sick. My fam ily avoided alcohol and coca, and we&rsquo;re all fine. We have learned to &nbsp;take the best possible care of our bodies and trust in God. He takes &nbsp;care of us.&rdquo;<br />
Every night at the school where they lived, Carlos lit a kerosene &nbsp;lamp. The soft light flowed out through the windows. The islanders &nbsp;imagined, The teacher is praying to protect his family from evil spirits. They believed the mountain has spirits and the lake has spirits. Spirits &nbsp;could punish and cause a person to die. The people were afraid of the &nbsp;spirit in the teacher&rsquo;s alarm clock.<br />
With life centering around witchcraft, the people kept a balsa as &nbsp;a spirit-shrine anchored near the entrance to their island. To appease &nbsp;the spirits, they worshiped the lake and made offerings by pouring the &nbsp;blood of birds into the water.<br />
Discussing this with Naomi, Carlos commented, &ldquo;The Uros are ig norant, fearful, and superstitious in many ways, but in other respects &nbsp;they are very intelligent. They know the lake like no one else. With the &nbsp;right education, they will live successful lives.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;One thing is sure,&rdquo; Naomi replied. &ldquo;They make good use of what &nbsp;they have.&rdquo;<br />
Primitive though the people were, the teacher and his wife found &nbsp;the floating island people remarkable. The men fished, cut totora, and &nbsp;built balsas. And not just one balsa. Each family had at least three. &nbsp;While one was for fishing, a larger balsa was used mainly by the women &nbsp;when they took products to the mainland to be sold or bartered. The &nbsp;larger balsas were also used for trips to the big islands like Taquili and<br />
99</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Amantan&iacute;. A small balsa served best to go through &nbsp;the reeds hunting bird &nbsp;eggs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Both men and women &nbsp;spent a lot of time cutting &nbsp;totora. They had to be con stantly adding new layers &nbsp;to their island as the bot tom rotted away. A balsa boat used daily may not last &nbsp;longer than a month, while &nbsp;one with little use might &nbsp;last nearly a year. A good &nbsp;reed hut would last almost &nbsp;a year, but before the rainy &nbsp;season the men always &nbsp;added totora to the roof of &nbsp;their huts.<br />
Women searched for &nbsp;dried totora to use as fuel &nbsp;for cooking. They spent a&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">lot of time cutting and drying fish. Two or three days before a fies ta, they would bake fish. Selling fresh, dried, and baked fish provid ed the main source of family income. Routine work kept the women &nbsp;constantly occupied.<br />
Carlos mentioned to his wife that he had been watching the &nbsp;men. &ldquo;They often leave at two or three in the morning to fish,&rdquo; he &nbsp;said. &ldquo;They seem to know exactly when and where to go. Only the &nbsp;Uros know why, but when there are bright moonlit nights they fish in &nbsp;the daytime.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And the women,&rdquo; Naomi said. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have calendars, but &nbsp;they know exactly when the fiestas are held. They always take their &nbsp;children in a balsa and go to Puno or Chucuito to sell their products. &nbsp;And they always remember to buy alcohol, coca leaves, sugar, and if &nbsp;they have money left over they buy bread too.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos and Naomi noticed that the men never went to fiestas in the &nbsp;city for fear of being picked up by the authorities for lack of legal docu ments. Yet they often ventured to fiestas held in rural areas.<br />
100</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">One young man came back from a fiesta with a little transistor &nbsp;radio. After a few weeks he came to Carlos at the school. Holding up &nbsp;his radio, he said, &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t talk anymore. Please fix it for me.&rdquo;<br />
What can I do? Carlos wondered. Since I&rsquo;ve never owned a radio, I &nbsp;don&rsquo;t know anything about fixing one.<br />
&ldquo;What do you do to make it play?&rdquo; he asked.<br />
&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; the boy said, pointing to a switch. &ldquo;This is how I turn it on &nbsp;and off. When I want to find a station I turn this little knob.&rdquo; &ldquo;Does your radio have batteries?&rdquo; Carlos questioned.<br />
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Please show me how you take them out.&rdquo; After the boy took the &nbsp;batteries out, Carlos asked him to put them back in again. Not under standing the positive and negative ends of the batteries, the boy had &nbsp;put them in backwards. &ldquo;Let me see the radio,&rdquo; Carlos requested. He took the batteries out &nbsp;and turned them around so that they had the proper connections for positive and negative.<br />
He handed the radio back to the boy, saying, &ldquo;Please turn it on.&rdquo; The boy turned it on, and it began to talk. &ldquo;Thank you! Thank you!&rdquo; the boy said with a big smile. He went back to his hut believing the teacher could fix anything. Both children and adults were fascinated by the boy&rsquo;s&nbsp;<br />
radio. &ldquo;How does it work?&rdquo; they kept asking Carlos. He didn&rsquo;t know how it worked, but he planned a way to help the people understand the mystery of radio. Carlos arranged for &nbsp;the school children to&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">101</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">visit a radio station. &ldquo;Be sure and keep the radio on all the time we are &nbsp;gone,&rdquo; he told the owner of the little radio. At the station, the program &nbsp;director had the children sing and then greet their families in Aymara.<br />
When they arrived back at their island, they were welcomed by &nbsp;excited family members. &ldquo;We heard you! We heard you on the radio!&rdquo; &nbsp;they shouted. &ldquo;Your voices talked on the radio.&rdquo; The children tried to &nbsp;explain how they spoke into microphones.<br />
This caught peoples&rsquo; attention, giving Carlos the opportunity to &nbsp;teach the parents that there is a God in heaven who hears us when we &nbsp;pray. &ldquo;You could hear your children&rsquo;s voices, even though they were in &nbsp;Puno,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In the same way, God is able to hear us when we talk &nbsp;to Him in prayer. We don&rsquo;t need to consult with evil spirits.&rdquo;<br />
While Carlos taught the Uro families many new things, his own &nbsp;family had much to learn. His children complained: &ldquo;Why did you &nbsp;bring us to live in such a horrible place? There&rsquo;s nowhere to play except &nbsp;on these spongy reeds or in the balsas. About all you feed us is fish. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re tired of fish. Every time we need to go to the bathroom, we have &nbsp;to borrow a balsa boat and go about 600 feet back into the totora reeds.&rdquo;<br />
Playing with the other children, they learned to handle balsas well. &nbsp;Looking out the window one day, Carlos saw his oldest son, four-year old Yban, fall off a balsa into the lake.<br />
Fear gripped his heart. My son can&rsquo;t swim and will drown. Horrified, &nbsp;he watched the boy disappear beneath the surface of the water.<br />
102</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Carlos ran out and shouted to children who were playing in a &nbsp;balsa. They managed to pull the boy out of the water with a long pole. &nbsp;Naomi had heard the commotion and reached her husband&rsquo;s side by &nbsp;the time the children with the balsa reached the edge of the island. &nbsp;They looked at the Yban&rsquo;s lifeless form. His little body had turned red.&nbsp;<br />
Having had a first-aid course, Carlos immediately began mouth to-mouth resuscitation on his little son. Naomi watched, and, seeing &nbsp;no reaction, she cried, &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo; Desperate to know what to do, &nbsp;she knelt by Carlos, who was already on his knees holding the boy.<br />
They stopped a moment to pray, and Carlos did more mouth-to mouth resuscitation. The boy coughed. Water poured out of his mouth &nbsp;when his father turned him over. A little more resuscitation, and the &nbsp;boy opened his eyes and began to breathe normally.<br />
Uros who watched the husband and wife pray began thinking, &nbsp;Maybe there is a God in heaven who answers prayer. Still holding the &nbsp;boy, Carlos hugged his wife. &ldquo;God is so good,&rdquo; he said. At the time &nbsp;they could not have imagined this boy would grow up and study medi<br />
cine. He moved to the United States and had his children educated at &nbsp;Andrews University.<br />
After almost losing his son, Carlos hired a man to build him a &nbsp;balsa. More important, he taught his children and the school children &nbsp;to swim.&nbsp;<br />
The Uros drank contaminated water taken out of the lake around &nbsp;their homes, and almost all of them suffered with parasites. Carlos and &nbsp;his family went out in the lake to get water where it was cleaner, and &nbsp;boiled it before drinking. Whenever possible, they also brought water &nbsp;from a spring in Chimo.<br />
A fifty-five gallon drum cut in half served as a bathtub. They filled &nbsp;it early in the day, let the water stand in the sun until bath time, and &nbsp;each family member took a turn getting a lukewarm bath. Carlos soon &nbsp;discovered that urging Uros who never had a bath in their life to take &nbsp;baths brought no results. Finally he invited them to a demonstration. &nbsp;The people laughed at first, but the idea began to catch on, and many &nbsp;began bathing.<br />
All the children suffered with fleas and lice, so Carlos went to the &nbsp;government health center and asked for help. The workers there gave &nbsp;him half a sack of a powerful insecticide and equipment for spraying &nbsp;it on. Knowing the Uros would be afraid to use it, he sprayed his own &nbsp;clothes, his living quarters, and the school, while the people watched.<br />
103</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">He asked his students, &nbsp;&ldquo;How many would like to &nbsp;be free from fleas and&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">lice?&rdquo; They began shout ing, &ldquo;Me, me, me!&rdquo; After he &nbsp;treated each one, they asked &nbsp;if they could have their reed &nbsp;homes sprayed too. Some &nbsp;parents were not sure, but &nbsp;in the end they agreed. The next day the children an nounced, &ldquo;Professor, we are &nbsp;free from fleas.&rdquo;<br />
God is so good, Carlos &nbsp;thought. I&rsquo;m sure He guided &nbsp;us to do this. The program &nbsp;proved so successful, he visited other floating islands and helped the people free their homes and &nbsp;bodies of insect pests too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;Have you noticed the people here get up grumpy and often com plain of headaches?&rdquo; Carlos asked his wife.<br />
&ldquo;Yes, and I think I know why. It&rsquo;s their poor health habits.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Well, they hardly eat any breakfast, they eat very little at midday, &nbsp;and then they eat a huge meal at night.&rdquo;<br />
Husband and wife began encouraging the people to eat a good &nbsp;healthy breakfast, a good meal at noon, and much less in the evening. &nbsp;Those who tried it found it beneficial. Carlos and Naomi realized, It &nbsp;won&rsquo;t be easy to change habits developed over the centuries and deeply &nbsp;ingrained in the culture. We need patience. Constantly watched, they &nbsp;did their best to set a good example.<br />
&ldquo;Naomi,&rdquo; Carlos said one morning. &ldquo;It seems like these supersti tious Uros are beginning to have confidence in the school.&rdquo; Later that &nbsp;morning the bright sun began to grow dark. Strange, Carlos thought. &nbsp;Not sure at first what was happening, he watched shadows creep across &nbsp;the lake as the sky darkened. Sun-worshiping Uros became hysteri cal when the sun disappeared, leaving only the white corona. They &nbsp;pounced on Carlos. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your fault. You&rsquo;re a devil,&rdquo; they shouted. &ldquo;We &nbsp;will die. We should have never let you bring a school to our islands.&rdquo;<br />
104</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">As the sun slowly began to reappear, Carlos explained. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just &nbsp;experienced a total solar eclipse. This happens when the moon passes &nbsp;between the earth and the sun. In a few minutes, the sun will shine as &nbsp;bright as ever.&rdquo; Anger turned to hope, and the people marveled at the &nbsp;knowledge of the teacher.<br />

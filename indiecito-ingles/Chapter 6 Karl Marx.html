<p><strong><span style="font-size:26px;">Chapter 6: Karl Marx</span></strong></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">After three years together at Chullunquiani, the four young men went different directions. Only Roberto stayed to &nbsp;complete secondary school and continue working as a liter ature evangelist in the summer. Emilio accepted a position teaching &nbsp;in an Adventist mission school. Juan was inducted into the army &nbsp;at Juliaca.<br />
On the day indicated in his papers, Carlos, with a sick feeling &nbsp;in the pit of his stomach, checked in at the Army Induction Center &nbsp;in Puno. An officer asked him to fill out forms, sign a pledge of loy alty to the government, and take an aptitude test. A captain ordered &nbsp;him to stand in a long line with new recruits who were being issued &nbsp;uniforms. What&rsquo;s going to happen to me now? he wondered. I really &nbsp;wanted to go back to Chullunquiani and finish school.<br />
&ldquo;Dear Lord,&rdquo; he prayed. &ldquo;You have led me in ways I never dreamed &nbsp;possible. Please keep me faithful now.&rdquo; He continued thinking. God &nbsp;has guided me all along. My time in a Christian school changed my life. &nbsp;I know the Holy Spirit was working when the priest showed us a Bible. &nbsp;What if he hadn&rsquo;t mentioned the Song of Songs? Where would I be if I &nbsp;hadn&rsquo;t bought a Bible? What would have happened if my parents hadn&rsquo;t &nbsp;changed their minds and let me go to Chullunquiani?<br />
The long line where Carlos stood grew shorter. He would be the &nbsp;next to get his uniform. A Bible verse he learned at school challenged &nbsp;him. &ldquo;You . . . must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ&rdquo; &nbsp;(2 Timothy 2:3). Ordered to take off his civilian clothes and put on a &nbsp;uniform, Carlos prayed, Dear Lord, please help me do my best to honor &nbsp;the rules and respect my superiors. Give me courage to remain true to &nbsp;the teachings of Jesus.<br />
Officers took notice of a young soldier who acted very different. &nbsp;&ldquo;This army private reads his Bible every day,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s studious &nbsp;and interested in learning.&rdquo;<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">One officer commented, &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s reading the Bible, he&rsquo;s read ing the wrong book. It will never make him a good soldier. We have &nbsp;books by Karl Marx that are published in Russia and translated into &nbsp;Spanish in Cuba. Let&rsquo;s share these with him. His foolish religious ideas &nbsp;will vanish.&rdquo;<br />
Not wanting to offend his superiors, Carlos began reading books &nbsp;filled with revolutionary ideas, like the three volumes of Das Kapital and the Communist Manifesto. Communist philosophy is right, he &nbsp;thought as the devil worked on his mind. Growing up as an Indian, I &nbsp;saw members of my own family exploited by the wealthy. The way they &nbsp;treat Aymaras is not right! Marx knows what he&rsquo;s talking about.<br />
Although this was ten years before Fidel Castro became the revo lutionary leader of Cuba, the ideas of this restless young Cuban and &nbsp;his mentors, like Che Guevara from Argentina, were being exported to &nbsp;poor nations in the Andes, including Peru and Bolivia. Carlos read the &nbsp;books and struggled in his mind with the ideas of Marxism, but as he &nbsp;looked for answers he also kept reading his Bible.<br />
I should have known, he thought. God understands all the injustice. &nbsp;Wicked oppressors will be judged. The Bible recognizes the problem by &nbsp;calling attention to people who take advantage of others for their own &nbsp;benefit. Bible verses almost leaped off the page as he read the book of &nbsp;James. &ldquo;Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries that &nbsp;are coming upon you! . . . The wages of the laborers who mowed your &nbsp;fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord. . . . You have lived on the earth in &nbsp;pleasure and luxury. . . . You have murdered the just; he does not resist &nbsp;you&rdquo; (5:1, 4&ndash;6).<br />
Carlos saw that the Bible calls attention to the evil deeds of the &nbsp;wicked and then says to those who have suffered at their hands, &ldquo;Therefore &nbsp;be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord&rdquo; (James 5:7).<br />
As Carlos read his Bible, he began to understand God&rsquo;s solution to &nbsp;social problems. Yes, there is injustice, he realized, but the world doesn&rsquo;t &nbsp;need a revolution. We need hearts and minds filled with love for others. &nbsp;Jesus makes it very clear that He will take care of the problems of society. &nbsp;He read what Matthew says concerning those who will be saved in &nbsp;God&rsquo;s kingdom:<br />
The King will say to those on His right hand, &ldquo;Come, you &nbsp;blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you<br />
50</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">from the foundation of the world: for I was hungry and you &nbsp;gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a &nbsp;stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed &nbsp;Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you &nbsp;came to Me.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, when &nbsp;did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You &nbsp;drink? When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or &nbsp;naked and clothe You? Or when did we see You sick, or in &nbsp;prison, and come to You?&rdquo; And the King will answer and &nbsp;say to them, &ldquo;Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did &nbsp;it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me&rdquo; &nbsp;(Matthew 25:34&ndash;40).<br />
Carlos weighed the issues. Karl Marx or Jesus? A verse he had &nbsp;memorized at school popped into his mind. &ldquo;Do not be overcome by &nbsp;evil, but overcome evil with good&rdquo; (Romans 12:21). Pastor Stahl came &nbsp;to Peru to help us. He loved us. He and Mrs. Stahl took care of the sick. &nbsp;They started schools to educate Indians in how to live better lives. They &nbsp;brought the gospel and filled us with hope.<br />
Why did my grandparents, Carlos wondered, reject the teachings of &nbsp;the Bible taught by Pastor Stahl? Because of the schools he started, I&rsquo;ve &nbsp;learned a lot during three years at Chullunquiani. The officers promote &nbsp;Marx. I&rsquo;m going to promote Jesus. He&rsquo;s the one with the real answers. I&rsquo;ll &nbsp;spend my life helping others. The best way to change the world is by doing &nbsp;good.<br />
Just a few days before completing two years of military service, &nbsp;Carlos faced another temptation. His commanding officer gave him &nbsp;a certificate that said, &ldquo;We recommend Sargent Carlos Velasquez to &nbsp;work for the police department.&rdquo; The commanding officer said, &ldquo;With &nbsp;this certificate you will get a job and earn a good salary. You&rsquo;ve been a &nbsp;good soldier in the military, and they&rsquo;re looking for men like you who &nbsp;can speak Aymara, Quechua, and Spanish.&rdquo;<br />
A job with a steady income! Great! Carlos thought. That&rsquo;s exactly &nbsp;what I need as I go back into civilian life. But wait. I promised to be &nbsp;baptized as soon as I got out of the army, he remembered. He learned &nbsp;that if he took a job as a police officer, he would be required to work &nbsp;on Sabbath.<br />
51</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Instead of applying for a police job when he left the army, Carlos &nbsp;headed straight for his home in Ccota. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said when he saw &nbsp;his parents. &ldquo;My tour in the army is over. The officers tried to persuade &nbsp;me to accept the principles of godless communism. They encouraged &nbsp;me to take a job where I would work on Sabbath. But I remember &nbsp;the promise I made. I&rsquo;m determined to follow Jesus. The Bible says, &nbsp;&lsquo;Repent, and . . . be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remis sion of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit&rsquo; [Acts 2:38].&rdquo;<br />
The very next Sabbath, Carlos and twenty-five others stood with &nbsp;the Mission president by the outdoor baptistry in Plater&iacute;a. With bright &nbsp;sunshine filling a vivid blue sky, Carlos stepped forward and entered &nbsp;the cold water. Pastor Oswaldo Krause raised his hand. &ldquo;My dear &nbsp;Brother Velasquez, because you have confessed all your sins, because &nbsp;you have chosen to live for Jesus and prepare for a home in heaven, I &nbsp;now baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son Jesus, and the Holy &nbsp;Spirit. Amen!&rdquo;<br />
Emilio and Ignacia Velasquez rushed up to give their son a big &nbsp;abrazo when he came out of the water. &ldquo;Carlos,&rdquo; his father said, &ldquo;God &nbsp;used you to give us the gospel of Jesus and hope for a home in heaven. &nbsp;We thank Him that today you joined us as part of God&rsquo;s family.&rdquo; The &nbsp;little church Carlos helped to organize in Ccota before leaving for the &nbsp;army voted him in as a member.<br />
A few weeks after his baptism, Carlos received a surprising mes sage. &ldquo;The president of the Lake Titicaca Mission wants to see you in his &nbsp;office.&rdquo; The next morning Carlos left for Puno. &ldquo;Hermano Velasquez,&rdquo; &nbsp;Pastor Krause greeted him. &ldquo;The Mission Committee voted to ask you &nbsp;to teach sixth grade at our Adventist school in Yanaoco. Will you ac cept the challenge?&rdquo;<br />
Without hesitation Carlos replied, &ldquo;Yes, Pastor Krause. I want to be &nbsp;a true soldier for Christ, so I&rsquo;m ready to go wherever God sends me.&rdquo; Teaching lively sixth graders proved difficult. Each day Carlos &nbsp;prayed, &ldquo;Lord, please help me to teach these boys and girls in a way &nbsp;that will honor Jesus.&rdquo;<br />
He did his best, but at the end of the year there was no invitation &nbsp;to teach another year. Why? he questioned. Am I a failure? Perhaps it&rsquo;s &nbsp;because I haven&rsquo;t completed secondary school.<br />
With no work for the Mission, Carlos went home to help his par ents on their farm. In the evenings he conducted classes for the Ccota &nbsp;youth. One day after several months, Carlos sat eating with his parents.<br />
52</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">His father looked across the small eucalyptus-wood table. &ldquo;Carlos, &nbsp;your mother and I have been talking. You are twenty-four years old. &nbsp;You need to find a wife.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos listened as thoughts ran through his mind. I guess they don&rsquo;t &nbsp;know I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about this. The Bible says, &ldquo;He who finds a wife &nbsp;finds a good thing, and obtains favor from the Lord&rdquo; (Proverbs 18:22). &nbsp;I bought books like Messages to Young People and What Every Young &nbsp;Man Should Know. These books have excellent counsel. One says, &ldquo;Young &nbsp;men should allow the Lord to choose their life companion.&rdquo; I believe this, &nbsp;and I&rsquo;m praying for divine guidance.&rdquo;<br />
His father continued. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an adult now. You need to decide &nbsp;who you want to marry so we can ask her parents to let her be your &nbsp;wife. We think Se&ntilde;orita Suera would make an ideal mate for you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Se&ntilde;orita Suera?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, she really likes you.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos appreciated his parents&rsquo; interest but kept thinking, I want &nbsp;God to choose for me. I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of girls at church and in youth &nbsp;meetings. I believe God will help me find the right one. His parents sug gested several other girls, but to each of them he said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;<br />
The Ccota church asked Carlos to serve as Sabbath School direc tor for the coming year. At the end of three months he went to Plater&iacute;a &nbsp;to report the quarter&rsquo;s activities. As he entered the gate going into the &nbsp;pastor&rsquo;s home, a house originally built by Pastor Stahl, an attractive &nbsp;young woman came out. I&rsquo;ve seen her at a distance, he thought, but &nbsp;we&rsquo;ve never met.<br />
He spoke first. &ldquo;Good morning, se&ntilde;orita, I&rsquo;m Carlos.&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Naomi.&rdquo; She smiled when Carlos shook her hand. &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; he asked.<br />
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sabbath School secretary for &nbsp;the Plater&iacute;a church, and I just left my report with the pastor. And you?&rdquo; &nbsp;she asked, looking at Carlos.<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sabbath School director in Ccota. I&rsquo;m coming to give my re port to the pastor.&rdquo; Without further conversation they said good-bye. Naomi is really nice, Carlos thought as he knocked on the pastor&rsquo;s &nbsp;door. In seconds, the door opened, he greeted the pastor, handed him &nbsp;his report, and turned to leave. On the way out he paused at the gate. I &nbsp;was coming, and she was leaving. What&rsquo;s going on inside of me? I&rsquo;ve never &nbsp;felt this way about any other woman. She seems like a real Christian. Did &nbsp;God plan for us to meet here at the gate?<br />
53</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">New thoughts rolled around in Carlos&rsquo;s mind. What shall I do? If &nbsp;I hurry, maybe she will still be around the plaza. He ran until he saw &nbsp;Naomi. She&rsquo;s not just nice, she&rsquo;s beautiful. I love the way she braids her &nbsp;hair. He approached and asked, &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Oh, I just bought a few things and now I&rsquo;m going home.&rdquo; They &nbsp;talked just long enough for Carlos to find out she lived in Huataraqui. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s near Lake Titicaca, he remembered. My parents own land in &nbsp;Huataraqui. That will give me an excuse to visit her.<br />
Carlos walked slowly toward home in Ccota. Naomi&mdash;what a beau tiful name. Naomi in the Bible was the mother-in-law of Ruth and a very &nbsp;gracious woman. Naomi! Naomi! Naomi! He could not get Naomi out &nbsp;of his mind. He&rsquo;d been obsessed with the Song of Songs and the Bible. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d been obsessed with Chullunquiani. Smitten more than ever, he &nbsp;became obsessed with Naomi.<br />
Early one morning, Carlos told his parents he was going to &nbsp;Huataraqui to check on the farm land they owned there. He really had &nbsp;something else in mind. He found Naomi out working alone. They &nbsp;greeted each other and began talking.<br />
Finally Carlos looked into Naomi&rsquo;s lovely brown eyes. &ldquo;I want to &nbsp;tell you what&rsquo;s on my heart,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t forget you. Ever since &nbsp;we met last Sunday I&rsquo;ve been thinking about you day and night. You&rsquo;re &nbsp;the best Christian woman I&rsquo;ve ever met.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;This is strange,&rdquo; she said shyly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about you too.&rdquo; &nbsp;Carlos could hardly believe what he heard. He continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &nbsp;been praying that God will guide me in finding the right person to &nbsp;share my life. Do you think God is leading us?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But what shall we do?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get married,&rdquo; Carlos blurted out. &ldquo;I believe God has chosen &nbsp;you for me.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s get married,&rdquo; Naomi agreed.<br />
Carlos&rsquo;s heart beat faster as he told Naomi good-bye and turned to &nbsp;walk home.<br />
What shall I do now? he wondered. I&rsquo;d better tell my parents since &nbsp;they&rsquo;ve been concerned about me.<br />
That evening Carlos talked with his father and mother. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve &nbsp;been telling me I should get married, right?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, you are surely old enough,&rdquo; they said.<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been praying, and God has helped me find the right one.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; they wanted to know.<br />
54</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Se&ntilde;orita Naomi. I met her at the gate in front of the pastor&rsquo;s &nbsp;home in Plater&iacute;a. She lives in Huataraqui.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Oh, we know Naomi. She&rsquo;s a fine young woman. Her mother died &nbsp;when she was very young, and after her father remarried, she went to &nbsp;live with her grandparents. They are faithful Adventistas. We need to &nbsp;ask her family for permission for her to marry you.&rdquo;<br />
The next day Carlos raced back to Huataraqui and found Naomi &nbsp;out working again. All out of breath, he said, &ldquo;I want you to know I &nbsp;will be coming back with my parents. They want to ask your family for &nbsp;permission for you to marry me.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Please do come,&rdquo; she said.<br />
Later that day, Emilio, Ignacia, and Carlos trudged across the &nbsp;pampa heading for the home of Naomi&rsquo;s grandparents. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been &nbsp;waiting for you,&rdquo; the grandparents said. &ldquo;Naomi told us you were com ing. What can we do for you?&rdquo;<br />
Emilio and Ignacia got right to the point. &ldquo;Our son loves Naomi, &nbsp;and we would like your permission for her to marry him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; the grandfather chuckled. &ldquo;I think we had better call &nbsp;her father.&rdquo;<br />
Minutes later, he was back with Naomi&rsquo;s father and stepmother. &nbsp;They listened attentively to the Velasquez family&rsquo;s request. Naomi&rsquo;s father hesitated before responding. &ldquo;We need time to &nbsp;think about this. We will talk it over. Come back the day after tomor row, and we will let you know our decision.&rdquo;<br />
After thanking them, the Velasquez family got up and left. Greatly &nbsp;troubled, Carlos questioned, What will I do if they say no? Why are &nbsp;they making us wait so long for an answer? Do they think I&rsquo;m not good &nbsp;enough for their daughter?<br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size:26px;">Chapter 4: Chullunquiani</span></strong></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">Carlos fell asleep thinking about life without interference from his parents. At nearly midnight, he awoke abruptly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Carlos! Carlos!&rdquo; He opened his eyes. Papa and Mama were &nbsp;standing by the bed, his father holding a candle. &ldquo;You are still here?&rdquo; &nbsp;Papa said.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m about to get up and leave. I have everything ready.&rdquo; &ldquo;Listen, Carlos,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;Your mother and I have been &nbsp;thinking about your future. Even though we are not Adventistas, let&rsquo;s &nbsp;talk about Chullunquiani with the pastor in Plater&iacute;a. We&rsquo;d hate to see &nbsp;you all alone in a big city like Arequipa.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos thought, I can learn to sing.<br />
At dawn, he stood with his father and mother on the doorstep of &nbsp;Pastor Sosa&rsquo;s home at the Plater&iacute;a Mission Station. Emilio thought to &nbsp;himself, Are these Protestants really devils like we&rsquo;ve always heard? He &nbsp;breathed deeply and knocked.<br />
The door opened, and Pastor Sosa smiled. &ldquo;Good morning! &nbsp;Welcome! Why have you come so early? Please come in, Don Emilio &nbsp;and Do&ntilde;a Ignacia. I&rsquo;ve heard about you. Is this your son?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they responded.<br />
&ldquo;Please sit down,&rdquo; the pastor said.<br />
Why were we so afraid? Emilio wondered. In Acora or Puno, they &nbsp;always have us sit on the ground with the other Indians. We&rsquo;ve never &nbsp;been treated so well.<br />
&ldquo;Don Emilio,&rdquo; Pastor Sosa spoke. &ldquo;Why are you here? What can we &nbsp;do for you? This is the first time you&rsquo;ve come to visit me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pastor, this son of ours wants to study at Chullunquiani. Like &nbsp;us, he doesn&rsquo;t know how to sing, he doesn&rsquo;t understand the Bible, and &nbsp;he doesn&rsquo;t know how to pray. Would it be possible for him to go to &nbsp;Chullunquiani? Would they accept him as a student? He completed the &nbsp;first year of secondary at Colegio San Carlos in Puno.&rdquo;<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; the pastor said, smiling at his visitors. &ldquo;There will &nbsp;not be a problem. They will teach him wonderful lessons found in the &nbsp;Bible. He will learn to sing gospel songs. He will get a good education.&rdquo;<br />
Immediately Carlos&rsquo;s father asked, &ldquo;How much will it cost?&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very reasonable,&rdquo; Pastor Sosa replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only two hundred &nbsp;soles for the entire year, including room and board. As part of a practi cal education, Carlos will be required to work.&rdquo;<br />
Emilio reached into his pocket. &ldquo;I brought fifty soles. May I give &nbsp;you fifty soles in advance?&rdquo;<br />
The pastor accepted the money and wrote out a receipt. Turning &nbsp;to the parents again, he said, &ldquo;Your son is registered. Be sure he gets to &nbsp;Chullunquiani before the end of March.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos and his parents trudged across the pampa heading home. &nbsp;Heavy rains the day before had flooded the area, and they walked care fully. Carlos could hardly believe the change in his parents. Last night &nbsp;my father said &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; and now he&rsquo;s made a deposit for me to study at &nbsp;Colegio Adventista del Lago Titicaca.&nbsp;<br />
They were almost home when Carlos saw a cousin who had the &nbsp;same name as his father, Emilio Velasquez. He left his parents and ran &nbsp;ahead. Reaching his cousin&rsquo;s home, he called, &ldquo;Hey, listen, I&rsquo;m going to &nbsp;Chullunquiani.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Emilio exclaimed. &ldquo;I want to go too! Let&rsquo;s go see Roberto &nbsp;who lives on up the hill.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Sure, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Carlos agreed.&nbsp;<br />
The two cousins were out of breath when they reached Roberto&rsquo;s &nbsp;home. Roberto came running out when the boys called. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; they &nbsp;said, &ldquo;both of us are going to Chullunquiani.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; Roberto congratulated them. &ldquo;I want to go too!&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;Now there are three of us going to Chullunquiani,&rdquo; Emilio said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you know Juan Flores who lives at the bottom of the hill? Why &nbsp;don&rsquo;t we talk to him?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Racing down the hill together, they saw Juan out walk ing and shouted, &ldquo;Juan! Hold up! We want to talk to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; they said when Juan reached them on the steep hillside. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all studied in Puno. We wanted you to know that the three of us &nbsp;are going to Chullunquiani.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Me too! I want to go,&rdquo; Juan said. &ldquo;When will we go?&rdquo;<br />
Carlos spoke up. &ldquo;The pastor at Plater&iacute;a says we have to be there &nbsp;before the end of the month.&rdquo;<br />
36</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, we&rsquo;d better talk with our parents right away.&rdquo; On that day, four boys who grew up in superstitious, spirit worshiping families got permission from their parents to go to the &nbsp;Adventist school. Another spirit was working&mdash;the Holy Spirit. By the end of March, the boys were ready with their bedding, &nbsp;clothing, and a very few personal belongings. The four looked for a &nbsp;truck to take them to Puno. With no trucks that morning, they decided &nbsp;to walk. After spending a night with friends in Puno, the boys found a &nbsp;truck headed for Juliaca. They climbed in with their bundles, sat hud dled together on the floor of the truck bed, and pulled their ponchos &nbsp;tightly around them to keep warm.<br />
The truck bounced along on a rough dirt road, stopping occa sionally to pick up other passengers who crowded in. One passenger &nbsp;warned the boys, &ldquo;When you get to Juliaca, you will have to walk three &nbsp;miles to reach the school at Chullunquiani.&rdquo;<br />
After a long, dusty ride on a washboard road, the truck stopped &nbsp;near the train station in Juliaca. The boys climbed out, asked for di rections to Chullunquiani, and started walking. The driver of a pick up stopped right beside them. &ldquo;Hey, boys,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Where are &nbsp;you going?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on our way to Chullunquiani.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; the driver said. &ldquo;Jump in the back and I&rsquo;ll &nbsp;take you there.&rdquo;<br />
The driver took off as soon as they had settled in the back of his &nbsp;pickup. Suddenly, fear filled their minds as they bumped along in a &nbsp;pickup driven by a total stranger. None of them spoke. How do we &nbsp;know he&rsquo;s going to the school? Carlos thought. Maybe he&rsquo;ll haul us off to &nbsp;some big hacienda and make us work as slaves.<br />
Their fears vanished when the boys saw a big sign saying, &ldquo;Colegio &nbsp;Adventista del Lago Titicaca.&rdquo; The pickup slowed down and drove &nbsp;through a gate in an adobe wall surrounding the school. The boys un loaded their bundles. Carlos looked around. This is different. I thought &nbsp;it would be like San Carlos in Puno. I don&rsquo;t see any school uniforms. &nbsp;&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said to the other boys. &ldquo;The girls are all dressed in polleras.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; they replied. &ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s dressed like Indians, and they&rsquo;re &nbsp;all out working. What kind of a place is this? Will we be slaves?&rdquo; The pickup drove away, and several students surrounded the boys. &nbsp;&ldquo;Welcome! Where are you from?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re from Plater&iacute;a,&rdquo; the boys answered.<br />
37</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re from Plater&iacute;a too, but we&rsquo;ve never seen you.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really from Ccota. You wouldn&rsquo;t know us because we&rsquo;ve &nbsp;never gone to the church in Plater&iacute;a.&rdquo;<br />
The school principal, Pastor Jacobs, came out and greeted the boys. &nbsp;&ldquo;I see you all have bundles with your belongings. You must be planning &nbsp;to attend school here.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Carlos said. &ldquo;I sent fifty soles with Pastor Sosa as the initial &nbsp;payment.&rdquo;<br />
The other boys said, &ldquo;We have our money and are ready to pay.&rdquo; After taking care of the financial arrangements, the principal led &nbsp;the boys to their room in the dormitory. &ldquo;We are putting you in room &nbsp;number seven,&rdquo; he said.<br />
The boys looked around. There were no beds, but in each corner &nbsp;of the room they saw adobe bricks stacked up about eighteen inches &nbsp;high, forming a place to sleep about the size of a camp cot. Like Carlos, &nbsp;all the boys were used to sleeping on a dirt floor, so this was not a &nbsp;problem.<br />
By mid-afternoon they were settled. Juan had brought a soccer &nbsp;ball. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go play,&rdquo; he suggested.&nbsp;<br />
They were having a great time when a teacher called, &ldquo;What are &nbsp;you doing?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re just playing.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; the teacher said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t play soccer here.&rdquo; The four young men frowned, picked up their ball, and walked &nbsp;back toward the dormitory. &ldquo;This is disgusting. How can you have a &nbsp;colegio without soccer?&rdquo; Juan muttered. &ldquo;Everything here is strange.&rdquo; Carlos remained silent. I talked these friends into coming to this &nbsp;school. What have we gotten ourselves into? Finally Carlos suggested, &nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go talk with the principal and ask for permission to play.&rdquo; Four unhappy young men trooped into Pastor Jacobs&rsquo;s office. &ldquo;Sir, &nbsp;the four of us come from a Catholic school in Puno. Please give us &nbsp;permission to play soccer.&rdquo;<br />
The school principal stood thinking for a long time. Not realizing &nbsp;a teacher had already told the boys they couldn&rsquo;t play, he finally said, &nbsp;&ldquo;All right, you can play for a while provided you stay right here in front &nbsp;of my office.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Thank you, sir, thank you very much.&rdquo;<br />
The boys began kicking their ball around, and other students came &nbsp;out to watch. &ldquo;Come join us,&rdquo; they called.<br />
38</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; they answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s prohibited. This school promotes physi cal labor for exercise. They teach us that competitive sports often create &nbsp;unhealthy attitudes. Have you heard how over 200 people were tram pled to death in a stadium during a soccer game in Lima?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
The boys grumbled but kept on playing. How can a school like this &nbsp;exist? You can&rsquo;t even play football. This is the most absurd thing we&rsquo;ve &nbsp;ever heard.<br />
At exactly 5:30 p.m. the bell rang. All the students headed to &nbsp;a building across the campus. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; a student called. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time &nbsp;to eat.&rdquo;<br />
The boys put away their soccer ball and followed the students &nbsp;headed for the dining room. I&rsquo;m really hungry, Carlos thought. I&rsquo;ll ask &nbsp;for churrasco and black coffee.<br />
Carlos reached the serving deck ahead of his companions. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;ora, &nbsp;please give me churrasco with strong black coffee.&rdquo;<br />
A smile broke across the woman&rsquo;s face. Trying not to laugh, she &nbsp;stepped up close. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re a brand new student,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t &nbsp;serve churrasco here. We want our students to have the best possible &nbsp;diet, so we only serve vegetarian food.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And what about coffee?&rdquo; Carlos asked.<br />
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t serve that either. We never give our students any drink &nbsp;containing caffeine.&rdquo;<br />
The four new students eyed each other. What will they feed us? All &nbsp;the students stared at them. They were served boiled potatoes, soup, &nbsp;salad, bread, and herb tea.<br />
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this. It&rsquo;s awful,&rdquo; Carlos blurted. &ldquo;Since there&rsquo;s nothing &nbsp;else, we&rsquo;ll have to eat it.&rdquo;<br />
After supper on Friday evening, the bell rang again and students &nbsp;began walking to the chapel, where they had assigned seats. For the &nbsp;first time since arriving at the school, the boys were separated. Carlos &nbsp;looked around. All the students were dressed in their best clothes and &nbsp;carried Bibles.<br />
I should run back and get my Bible&mdash;the one I bought at the Sunday &nbsp;market, he thought. Realizing the meeting was starting, he decided to &nbsp;stay where he was. Looking around, he noticed that not only did every one have a Bible, they all had hymnals too.<br />
Carlos was embarrassed to be in everyday clothes when everyone &nbsp;was dressed up. He asked himself, Do I really want to learn to sing? He &nbsp;listened. These students certainly sing with some gusto.<br />
39</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Suddenly all the students were on their knees. What are they doing &nbsp;now? Carlos wondered. He looked for his friends. They were kneeling &nbsp;like everyone else. Oh, no! I&rsquo;m the only one standing. I&rsquo;d better kneel too.&nbsp;<br />
Everyone had their eyes closed, so he closed his too. Before he real ized it, everyone was back in their seats. This is terrible. I&rsquo;m the only one &nbsp;kneeling and they&rsquo;re all looking at me. I just keep doing the wrong thing. &nbsp;Why did I come to this school?<br />
Back in the dormitory, the Adventist students told them the pro gram they had just attended was called vespers. &ldquo;We do this every &nbsp;Friday at sundown to welcome God&rsquo;s holy Sabbath. The Bible teaches &nbsp;us to honor Jesus and keep the seventh-day Sabbath from sundown &nbsp;to sundown. It starts at sunset Friday and ends when the sun goes &nbsp;down Saturday.&rdquo;<br />
After breakfast the next morning, the boys attended Sabbath &nbsp;School, where they sang and studied from the Bible. Next came a ser mon by a pastor who challenged them to be faithful, true, and honest.<br />
After lunch the boys joined a group of students and a teacher for &nbsp;a walk up the hill behind the school. Having grown up in the country, &nbsp;Carlos loved the things of nature. The teacher explained how a loving &nbsp;God made all the beauty of nature for us to enjoy.<br />
Later in the afternoon Carlos and his friends went to a meeting &nbsp;where young people led out in the program. They were impressed &nbsp;when many students repeated Bible verses they had learned during &nbsp;the week.&nbsp;<br />
Over the weekend, the boys got to know some of the other stu dents from Plater&iacute;a. They said, &ldquo;We know everything is new and dif ferent for you, but we will help you all we can.&rdquo; The pastor and teachers &nbsp;took an interest in the four boys, encouraging them and helping them &nbsp;to adapt. By Sunday morning, when they got their work assignments, &nbsp;they were beginning to feel much more at home.<br />
Roberto and Juan were sent to work on the farm. Carlos and his &nbsp;cousin Emilio were assigned to work in the kitchen. Carlos mused, &nbsp;There&rsquo;s one thing we won&rsquo;t be doing. We won&rsquo;t be preparing churrasco. &nbsp;What kind of food will we prepare?<br />
While working in the kitchen, the girls often sang, and they asked &nbsp;Carlos to join them in singing hymns. Soon he learned the words and &nbsp;stayed on tune. This is great, Carlos thought. Ever since the priest told us &nbsp;about the Bible and the Song of Songs, I wanted to learn to sing so I could &nbsp;serenade the girls. Now these girls are teaching me to sing.<br />
40</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">On Monday, Carlos and his friends attended their first classes. &nbsp;That evening Carlos told his roommates, &ldquo;My Bible class is really inter esting. I&rsquo;m learning things I never heard before.&rdquo;<br />
Another boy said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m amazed that every teacher, whether it&rsquo;s in &nbsp;science, or math, or language&mdash;they all pray at the beginning of class.&rdquo; The four boys who, at the beginning, had found everything strange &nbsp;and different began to settle down and enjoy their work and study. &nbsp;Carlos would be the first to get into trouble.<br />
Having grown up in a family that practiced witchcraft, Carlos had, &nbsp;while living with his cousin in Puno, become interested in the occult &nbsp;and learned to read palms. One day at work, he mentioned this to a girl &nbsp;who, like him, came from a home that knew nothing about the Bible. &nbsp;Immediately she wanted her palm read.<br />
&ldquo;All you will have to do is tell me the exact date of your birth. After &nbsp;that I will look at the lines in the palms of your hands and tell your &nbsp;fortune.&rdquo; Word circulated among the students that Carlos could tell &nbsp;the future. Other students with pagan backgrounds asked to have their &nbsp;palms read. This went on for several weeks until a teacher discovered &nbsp;what Carlos was doing and told the school principal.<br />
After worship in the dormitory one evening, the dean of boys &nbsp;asked Carlos to stay behind. &ldquo;Carlos,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the school principal &nbsp;wants to see you in his office.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;When?&rdquo; Carlos wanted to know.<br />
&ldquo;You should go see him right now. It&rsquo;s urgent.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos headed for the principal&rsquo;s office. Why does he want to see &nbsp;me? What have I done? All the years I studied in San Carlos, I never got &nbsp;in trouble. Why am I in trouble now?<br />

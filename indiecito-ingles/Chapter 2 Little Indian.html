<p><span style="font-size:26px;"><strong>Chapter 2: Little Indian</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Although forced to marry against their wishes, Emilio and Ignacia began respecting each other more as their children &nbsp;grew. One evening, smoke filled their one-room hut while &nbsp;Ignacia prepared the evening meal over a fire burning sheep chips. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ignacia.&rdquo; Emilio broke the silence. &ldquo;I keep thinking about Carlos. &nbsp;An education would be a big advantage if he becomes a witch doctor, &nbsp;but he&rsquo;s learned nothing in our schools.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t send him to a &nbsp;mission school, so what can we do?&rdquo; Ignacia questioned.<br />
&ldquo;I hear there&rsquo;s a school in Puno called San Carlos.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;San Carlos? You mean there&rsquo;s a school with our son&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Emilio assured his wife. &ldquo;And they have a special class for children who don&rsquo;t speak Spanish.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Where could he stay?&rdquo; Ignacia asked. &ldquo;Carlos is only eight years old and small for his age.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking with relatives,&rdquo; Emilio replied.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;Carlos&rsquo;s cousin Feliciano &nbsp;is ten. He is two years older &nbsp;than Carlos and more mature. &nbsp;He wants to go to school, and&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">his parents found a small room for rent at No. 7, Calle de la Libertad. The two boys can share a room.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Sounds like a good idea,&rdquo; Ignacia said, &ldquo;but what about the sheep?&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a problem. His sister Clarita has been taking care of the &nbsp;sheep while he went to the rural school. She&rsquo;s a good worker, and girls &nbsp;don&rsquo;t need an education anyway,&rdquo; Emilio declared.<br />
Without telling their son, Emilio and Ignacia began finalizing the &nbsp;plans. He had been an obedient boy, but when they finally told him, &nbsp;Carlos exploded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to leave home,&rdquo; he said loudly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t &nbsp;speak Spanish. Who will take care of Feliciano and me if we get sick?&rdquo;<br />
After much persuasion, Carlos agreed to his parents&rsquo; plan. His &nbsp;father prepared three burros for the trip. It would take all day to go &nbsp;twenty-one miles to Puno.<br />
Long before dawn the next morning, Emilio called, &ldquo;Hurry, Carlos! &nbsp;We need to go.&rdquo; Carlos rubbed his eyes, jumped up, and helped his fa ther load the burros. One burro carried bedding and rough lumber &nbsp;that Emilio planned to use to make a bed for the boys. The second was &nbsp;loaded with food supplies&mdash;potatoes, barley, quinoa, and other grains. &nbsp;Carlos mounted the third burro.&nbsp;<br />
Ignacia gave her son a kiss. The boy&rsquo;s response, &ldquo;Hasta luego, &nbsp;Mama,&rdquo; seemed too final. Warm tears trickled down her cheeks as she &nbsp;watched Carlos ride away and disappear.<br />
By noon, father and son reached the village of Chucuito. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s un load the burros,&rdquo; father said. &ldquo;They need to rest while we have lunch.&rdquo; Continuing the journey, they found the narrow road around the &nbsp;rocky Curva de Chimo flooded by the rising lake. With no way to pass, &nbsp;they took a detour up over the mountain and down past Salcedo. They &nbsp;were coming down the mountain in the late afternoon when Carlos &nbsp;heard a strange sound echoing off the mountain. &ldquo;Papa, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; &nbsp;he asked.<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the whistle on the steam engine,&rdquo; Papa answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the train &nbsp;coming into Puno.&rdquo; Carlos had never seen a train and could not imag ine what it would look like.<br />
Emilio walked ahead, leading the three burros along the main &nbsp;road going into the city. Children playing on the street saw Carlos, &nbsp;dressed in typical Aymara Indian clothing, riding on the back of the &nbsp;third burro. They began shouting, &ldquo;Look! Look! A little indio!&rdquo; Indio &nbsp;was the first Spanish word Carlos ever learned. What do they mean? he &nbsp;wondered. Is Indian something bad?<br />
24</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Arriving at the rented room on Calle de la Libertad, father and &nbsp;son found that cousin Feliciano and his father Pedro, Emilio&rsquo;s oldest &nbsp;brother, were already there. The tiny room with adobe walls, thatched &nbsp;roof, and a dirt floor opened off a small patio. The two brothers took &nbsp;the lumber Emilio had brought and built a small bed.&nbsp;<br />
After eating some of the food brought from home, the two fathers &nbsp;took the boys up the narrow cobblestoned Calle de la Libertad to find &nbsp;the school. Colegio San Carlos faced the attractive Parque Pino. Once &nbsp;inside, they were greeted in Aymara by Professor Humberto Paca. He &nbsp;helped the boys register for classes and then turned to their fathers. &nbsp;&ldquo;Your boys need to buy pencils and tablets,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They need to be &nbsp;back here when classes begin tomorrow morning.&rdquo; After purchasing &nbsp;the school supplies, the men took their sons back to the room.<br />
Confident his son would have success in school, Emilio had sold a &nbsp;cow before coming to Puno. Bargaining with the room owner, he used &nbsp;the money to pay three years&rsquo; advance rent on the room. With money &nbsp;left over, he turned to Carlos. &ldquo;Your mother sent you food to last for &nbsp;months, but you will need to buy bread. Here&rsquo;s enough money to buy &nbsp;pancitos every day for a long time.&rdquo;<br />
Soon headed home, Emilio led the three burros along the narrow &nbsp;streets of Puno. Thoughts of happiness flooded his mind. Ignacia and I &nbsp;often communicate with spirits. They&rsquo;ll watch over Carlos and Feliciano. &nbsp;My boy will get the education I wanted. He&rsquo;ll make a great witch doctor.<br />
Back in the room, Carlos realized that his father had left without &nbsp;saying good-bye. What if I get sick? he worried. I hardly know Feliciano. &nbsp;What will we do if we can&rsquo;t get along? Why did I have to leave home to &nbsp;come to school?<br />
Feliciano, too, remained quiet after his father left. The two lonely &nbsp;boys did not know about a God in heaven who loves little Indians. &nbsp;People from every race and nation are precious to Him. This God loves &nbsp;to watch over children even if they don&rsquo;t know Him.&nbsp;<br />
The two boys began to talk. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s explore Puno,&rdquo; Feliciano sug gested. Together they hurried off and found the Plaza de Armas. They &nbsp;stood in awe at the sight of the huge cathedral. They ran all the way &nbsp;to the port and watched a small steamship, the Ollanta, sail in from &nbsp;Bolivia. Then the train whistle blew, and the boys raced to the railroad &nbsp;station. They marveled as the steam engine came rolling in, followed &nbsp;by a long line of railway cars. As passengers climbed off, men fought to &nbsp;carry their baggage.<br />
25</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">The boys discovered the Mercado, and Carlos bought ten pancitos for one sole. Back in their dingy room, Carlos built a fire in one cor ner, and Feliciano helped him prepare potato soup with quinoa. With &nbsp;no chimney, smoke filled the room, irritating their eyes. At home &nbsp;where their mothers did the cooking, they could run outside when &nbsp;the smoke got too bad. Now they had to stay and watch what they &nbsp;were cooking.<br />
Their first night in Puno was the last night the boys ever slept on &nbsp;the bed. Rough hard boards and no mattress&mdash;by morning their backs &nbsp;and shoulders ached. From then on they found it more comfortable to &nbsp;sleep on the dirt floor.<br />
Their first breakfast alone included toasted barley, quinoa, and hot &nbsp;tea. On most days, however, breakfast was two or three pancitos and a &nbsp;drink of hot water with sugar.&nbsp;<br />
Remembering that all he had done in the country school was play, &nbsp;Carlos wondered, What will it be like in a city school? Arriving early &nbsp;for classes, he discovered they would not attend school with the city &nbsp;children. The two boys were assigned to a special room for Indian stu<br />
dents. Carlos thought, No wonder children shouted &ldquo;indiocito&rdquo; when I &nbsp;came riding into town on a burro. They&rsquo;re right&mdash;I&rsquo;m just a little Indian. &nbsp;His teacher spoke Aymara and Quechua as well as Spanish. The &nbsp;segregated class consisted of eight little Aymaras and ten Quechuas. &nbsp;After a few weeks Carlos said to Feliciano, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m learning a lot more &nbsp;Quechua than Spanish.&rdquo;<br />
Feliciano complained, &ldquo;I hate being segregated from Spanish speaking children. Our textbooks are in Spanish, but I need to listen &nbsp;and talk if I&rsquo;m going to learn the language of our country.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;At least the teacher is patient with us,&rdquo; Carlos said. &ldquo;I think he &nbsp;really wants to help his Indian students.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos tried to make up for lack of contact with Spanish-speaking &nbsp;children by using the Spanish words he learned with every adult who &nbsp;was willing to talk to him. By the end of the school year, he had com pleted both kindergarten and the first grade. Ignacia felt proud when &nbsp;her son came home for the summer speaking a lot of Spanish. While &nbsp;herding sheep for three months, Carlos reviewed what he had learned &nbsp;from his Spanish textbooks.<br />
When summer vacation ended in March, Carlos joined his cousin &nbsp;back in Puno, where he was transferred to a class with mestizo chil dren. This is great, Carlos thought. Now I can be with children who grew<br />
26</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">up speaking Spanish. I don&rsquo;t care if they call me little Indian. I&rsquo;m going to &nbsp;be an Indian who knows the language of my country.<br />
For a nine-year-old, living with an eleven-year-old cousin in the &nbsp;city without parental guidance proved difficult. Often hungry, Carlos &nbsp;sold newspapers to earn a few extra soles to buy pancitos. It was the &nbsp;same routine year after year. Sleep on a dirt floor at night, study, sell &nbsp;newspapers or carry baggage for tourists during nine months of the &nbsp;year, and then go home and herd sheep during the summer months.<br />
By age fourteen, Carlos had finished six years of primary school &nbsp;and entered the first year of secondary. Arriving home after classes one &nbsp;evening, he was greeted by his landlord. &ldquo;Please meet Emilio Porcela &nbsp;from the Uros.&rdquo;<br />
Uros! Carlos thought. That&rsquo;s the floating islands I used to see from &nbsp;the top of Mount Ccota Ccollo.<br />
He greeted Se&ntilde;or Emilio Porcela in Aymara. &ldquo;Kamisaraki.&rdquo; He &nbsp;added, &ldquo;I like your name. My father&rsquo;s name is Emilio.&rdquo; As they shook hands, Carlos looked at the man&rsquo;s face. How sad! &nbsp;This man&rsquo;s blind.<br />
The landlord spoke again. &ldquo;I have a friend who sells artifacts for &nbsp;witchcraft. He wants a witch doctor to bless his business. Se&ntilde;or Porcela &nbsp;will have a special ceremony here tonight.&rdquo;<br />
What will that be like? Carlos wondered. My parents talked about &nbsp;witchcraft all the time. I wonder what the witch doctor will do. A bright moon stood overhead just before midnight. The witch &nbsp;doctor and his superstitious client stepped out into the small patio and &nbsp;built a fire. The salesman brought tiny lead replicas of the things he &nbsp;wanted to sell&mdash;little lead animals and figures of angels. A small ban ner was attached to each one.<br />
The blind witch doctor rubbed llama grease over each item. One &nbsp;by one these were placed on the fire. The little banners burned, and &nbsp;the lead objects melted away. The witch doctor looked to the moon &nbsp;overhead and, making strange sounds, began to pray to the spirits. The &nbsp;salesman, feeling sure of success in his business, happily paid for the &nbsp;witch doctor&rsquo;s service.<br />
Fascinated by what he saw, Carlos went back to his room and &nbsp;curled up in his blankets on the dirt floor, never dreaming he would &nbsp;meet the witch doctor again.<br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size:26px;">Chapter 8: Worthless?</span></strong></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">I&rsquo;m sure glad Naomi likes the idea of going to Cusco, Carlos re flected. After a year of marriage, I know more than ever that she is the one God chose for me. Few women would put up with what &nbsp;we&rsquo;ve been through this past year. She&rsquo;s agreed to go to Cusco, but how &nbsp;can we get there? We have no money. And my parents can&rsquo;t help.<br />
Carlos explained his dilemma to Naomi. &ldquo;Carlos,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I &nbsp;still have four sheep on my grandmother&rsquo;s farm. We could sell them &nbsp;and use the money to buy train tickets.&rdquo;<br />
They were staying with his parents, who gave them plenty to &nbsp;eat, but he realized it would not be good to continue to let them &nbsp;provide for their needs. Confiding in his wife, he said, &ldquo;I hate to &nbsp;sell your sheep, but I see no other way to get to Cusco. We&rsquo;ll have &nbsp;to go on faith, because we don&rsquo;t know the area and I don&rsquo;t have a &nbsp;job when we get there. All we have is a Bible promise, &lsquo;He who &nbsp;walks righteously . . . bread will be given him, his water will be sure&rsquo; &nbsp;[Isaiah 33:15, 16].&rdquo;<br />
Before going to the grandmother&rsquo;s home to get the sheep, they &nbsp;prayed. &ldquo;Dear Lord, You know our situation. If it&rsquo;s Your will for us to &nbsp;go to Cusco, please help us sell the sheep.&rdquo;<br />
Will God answer our prayer? they wondered. Someone came &nbsp;wanting to buy meat, so they butchered the animals. Another per son bought the wool, and a man came and paid a good price for the &nbsp;hide. God has shown us His will, they concluded. &ldquo;We have money to &nbsp;buy the train tickets and some left over to buy food for our first few &nbsp;days in Cusco,&rdquo; Carlos said. Before doing anything else, they returned &nbsp;tithe on the money earned from selling the sheep.<br />
Hearing his daughter&rsquo;s sheep were sold, Naomi&rsquo;s father came to &nbsp;see Carlos. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re nothing but a worthless bum,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never &nbsp;should have let Naomi marry you. You&rsquo;re a total failure. How do you &nbsp;think you&rsquo;re going to live in Cusco? I despise you!&rdquo;<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">The cutting words from his father-in-law hurt deeply. Carlos &nbsp;thought, All I can do now is pray things will work out. What he says is &nbsp;true. I haven&rsquo;t finished secondary school, and I certainly haven&rsquo;t provided &nbsp;for Naomi during our first year of marriage. She&rsquo;s the one who kept us &nbsp;from starving, and her money will take us to Cusco.<br />
They were getting ready to leave when someone said, &ldquo;The Mission &nbsp;plans to build a church in Cusco. It will be the first Adventist church &nbsp;in the old Inca capital.&rdquo; Realizing it might be difficult to get work in &nbsp;Cusco, Carlos said, &ldquo;This is something we had better check on.&rdquo; They &nbsp;went to the Mission and asked to see church administrators.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re moving to Cusco,&rdquo; Carlos announced. &ldquo;I hear you will be &nbsp;building a church there. Will you need anyone to work in construction?&rdquo; &ldquo;We plan to start in three months,&rdquo; Pastor Krause said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure &nbsp;some kind of work will be available. Why don&rsquo;t you come and talk with &nbsp;us when we start the project?&rdquo;<br />
Early the next morning, Carlos and Naomi purchased fourth-class &nbsp;tickets and squeezed onto a hard wooden bench in the last railcar on &nbsp;the train. Three bells rang. The whistle blew. The steam engine lurched &nbsp;forward, pulling the train as they moved out of the station along the &nbsp;edge of Lake Titicaca. By early afternoon, the train stopped at La Raya, &nbsp;the continental divide at 14,172 feet elevation.<br />
Carlos and Naomi got out and walked around. Looking east, they &nbsp;saw the glacier on the Vilcanota mountains. &ldquo;It looks like a huge dia mond reflecting the afternoon sun,&rdquo; Naomi commented. &ldquo;And what a &nbsp;brilliant blue sky!&rdquo;<br />
Melting ice on the glacier formed a small stream that divided, &nbsp;some of the water flowing to Lake Titicaca and the rest flowing all the &nbsp;way to the Amazon and the Atlantic. Life is like this stream, Carlos &nbsp;thought. Choices determine our destination. You never know where the &nbsp;next turn will take you.&nbsp;<br />
The whistle blew, and they hurried back on board, reaching their &nbsp;seats as the train slowly began to move. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so beautiful here,&rdquo; Carlos &nbsp;said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been this close to a glacier before. But I&rsquo;m feeling &nbsp;sad, Naomi. I hated to leave Ccota with your father feeling the way &nbsp;he does.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Carlos. He&rsquo;ll get over it. He&rsquo;d be happy if you were &nbsp;working as a policeman in Puno with a good salary, but I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve &nbsp;chosen to be faithful to Jesus, regardless of the cost. We may have dif ficult times in Cusco, but it will all work out for the best.&rdquo;<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Carlos smiled. &ldquo;Every day I thank God for a faithful wife like you. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll never forget the day we met at the pastor&rsquo;s gate in Plater&iacute;a. I knew &nbsp;God was telling me you were the one.&rdquo;<br />
The train picked up speed. Dropping in elevation, they passed huge &nbsp;alpaca and sheep haciendas with thousands of animals. The day grew &nbsp;dark before the train finally pulled into Cusco. The trip from Puno &nbsp;over the continental divide and down into Cusco had taken more than &nbsp;ten hours. Immediately people began shoving and pushing as they &nbsp;grabbed their things and scrambled off the train.<br />
Each day, Carlos looked for work, but no job offers came. Soon &nbsp;the little money left from the sale of the sheep was gone. Things could &nbsp;not have looked more bleak. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sell the primus we got as a wedding &nbsp;present,&rdquo; Naomi suggested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find paper in people&rsquo;s trash and use it &nbsp;to cook with.&rdquo; The most anyone would pay was five soles, so they decided to keep the stove.<br />
Carlos began working as a cargador, even though it was considered &nbsp;the most demeaning work anyone could do. He met trains and carried &nbsp;luggage for the more affluent passengers, who usually gave him fifty &nbsp;centavos. With this he could buy five pancitos. Naomi laughed. &ldquo;You &nbsp;showed me where the Bible says our bread and water will be sure.&rdquo;<br />
One man offered Carlos carpentry work on condition he would &nbsp;work on Sabbaths. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll work any day except Saturday, but my con science doesn&rsquo;t allow me to work on the Bible Sabbath,&rdquo; he explained.<br />
&ldquo;Sorry, Se&ntilde;or Velasquez, I won&rsquo;t be able to use you,&rdquo; the man said. He found another job that had the same problem. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to &nbsp;work on Saturday,&rdquo; the man insisted. Then Carlos interviewed with the &nbsp;owner of a lumber yard. This man agreed to let Carlos work planing &nbsp;lumber with a hand plane. On Friday afternoon, he received his pay &nbsp;and rushed out to find his wife. &ldquo;Naomi, here&rsquo;s fifteen soles.&rdquo; They hur ried to the market to buy a little food before sundown. During three months living on little more than bread and water, &nbsp;Carlos lost so much weight that he looked like nothing more than a &nbsp;pile of skin and bones. Pastor Krause arrived and announced, &ldquo;We are &nbsp;ready to start building the church. You can live at the construction site &nbsp;so you won&rsquo;t have to pay rent, and we&rsquo;ll pay you six soles a day.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank you, Pastor Krause. Every time I found work they insisted &nbsp;I work on Sabbath, so I&rsquo;ve had very little work.&rdquo; Laughing, he contin ued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so weak from lack of food, I can hardly pick up a toothpick. I &nbsp;can hardly wait to start really eating again.&rdquo;<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">The builders threw away lots of scrap wood, and Naomi used these &nbsp;to cook, which saved buying kerosene to cook with the primus. Carlos &nbsp;took her to the dressmaker&rsquo;s college, and she enrolled in classes. The &nbsp;cost of thirty soles a month placed a heavy strain on their budget. &ldquo;It &nbsp;will be worth it in the future,&rdquo; they decided. At the same time, Carlos &nbsp;signed up to complete his secondary education at night school.&nbsp;<br />
The couple&rsquo;s first son was born just before classes started the next &nbsp;year. As the days passed, they woke the baby up at 3:00 a.m. so he &nbsp;would sleep at the construction site while Carlos worked and Naomi &nbsp;attended classes. This worked fine for two months, but then the baby &nbsp;started sleeping less.<br />
Carlos wondered, What can we do? I can&rsquo;t take care of the baby and &nbsp;work at the same time. They visited the dressmaking instructor. &ldquo;We have &nbsp;a baby and no place to leave him. Would you let the baby come to school?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making a very unusual request,&rdquo; the woman said and then &nbsp;smiled. &ldquo;Sure, I have a place where he can sleep. I think we can work &nbsp;this out.&rdquo;<br />
Because of the teacher&rsquo;s kindness, Naomi finished the two-year &nbsp;course and received her dressmaking diploma. At the same time, &nbsp;Carlos completed secondary school. By now he not only served as &nbsp;caretaker of the church site but worked full time in construction, &nbsp;served as paymaster, and took care of the accounts. After another year &nbsp;of construction, the Cusco Adventist church was completed.<br />
&ldquo;God has been so good,&rdquo; Carlos said to his wife one day. &ldquo;We came &nbsp;here with nothing. Now you have a diploma in dressmaking and are &nbsp;ready to teach others how to sew. I&rsquo;ve completed my secondary educa tion, which will be a big advantage in getting a teaching job. With the &nbsp;practical experience I&rsquo;ve gained in construction, I&rsquo;m ready to tackle &nbsp;most any building project. And praise God, we have a happy, healthy &nbsp;boy.&rdquo; In the back of his mind, Carlos had one concern. What will my &nbsp;father-in-law say now? Does he still think I&rsquo;m worthless?<br />
With the Cusco church completed, the Mission president and trea surer came for the dedication. After reviewing the financial records &nbsp;Carlos kept, Pastor Krause said, &ldquo;We want you to stay another six months &nbsp;while Pastor Amaro Peverini conducts a series of evangelistic meetings.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
The treasurer, Brother Wilbur Olson, added, &ldquo;Congratulations! &nbsp;You are honest. In all the thousands of soles you&rsquo;ve handled, we can &nbsp;only find a loss of thirty centavos, which is nothing.&rdquo; Pleased with &nbsp;Carlos&rsquo;s work, both men gave him a big abrazo.<br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size:26px;">Chapter 10: &ldquo;I Won&rsquo;t Wear a Necktie&rdquo;</span></strong></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">God&rsquo;s Word is clear, I reminded myself. The gospel is for every &ldquo;tribe, tongue, and people&rdquo; [Revelation 14:6]. That includes the &nbsp;Uros. But who can we take to the Uros to translate into their &nbsp;language? I thought about pastors and mission station directors who &nbsp;could do a good job. But they are always busy, and I hate to take them &nbsp;away from their work.<br />
The more I prayed for guidance, one name kept popping up in my &nbsp;mind&mdash;Carlos Velasquez. This man has convictions, I told myself. I had &nbsp;admired Carlos ever since he said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t wear a necktie.&rdquo; He was &nbsp;right when he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a stupid American custom.&rdquo; Sure, he didn&rsquo;t &nbsp;know the custom started in France, but it had not taken long for North &nbsp;Americans to adopt a custom that has no practical use. After living &nbsp;in Thailand for two years, I&rsquo;m convinced that banded collars without &nbsp;neckties are the smart way to go.<br />
With Carlos&rsquo;s experience growing up in a home practicing witch craft, he had a good understanding of the superstitions and fears of the &nbsp;native people. I approached him. &ldquo;Carlos, my wife and I plan to visit &nbsp;the floating islands with a friend from Lima. We want to try reaching &nbsp;the people with medical work. Will you translate for us?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;These people are very suspicious of the &nbsp;rest of the world. Many believe the chief purpose of the white man is to &nbsp;poison their fish so the Uros will die and the white race can take over &nbsp;the lake. Their gods are the sun and the moon. They have a dreadful &nbsp;fear of spirits.&rdquo;<br />
Our challenge was to reach these pagan people with the gospel. &nbsp;One day, four of us, Carlos Velasquez, Bill Jamerson, Evelyn, and I, &nbsp;reached the port of Puno at sunrise. We loaded our medical equipment &nbsp;and a sack of bread into the Maranatha, the boat my wife and I built, &nbsp;and climbed aboard. Soon we were speeding through the canal out &nbsp;toward the main lake.<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Carefully, we made our way through a narrow channel in the reeds, &nbsp;cut the motor, and drifted up on the floating totora edge of Torani Pata. &nbsp;Men ran out with long poles. What will happen now? I remembered &nbsp;how we&rsquo;d been chased off before.&nbsp;<br />
Carlos, followed by Bill Jamerson, stepped out on the floating &nbsp;reed island. I don&rsquo;t know what Carlos told the people, but within five &nbsp;minutes after our arrival there were no more long poles in sight, and Bill had persuaded the old queen of the tribe to lie on a reed mat and enjoy a&nbsp;<br />
vigorous back rub.<br />
We couldn&rsquo;t help laughing as we watched thick layers of dirt being rubbed off. Even though the old woman had been surrounded by water all her life, she had probably never had a bath. The people claimed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too cold! A bath will make us sick.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Although we don&rsquo;t know &nbsp;for sure, some think that our&nbsp;<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">the full-blooded Uros. This older woman, &nbsp;who acted as though she &nbsp;was queen of the island, &nbsp;loved her back rub and told the rest of the peo ple to let us do what ever we wanted to do&nbsp;<br />
for them. With this rec ommendation, Bill andmy wife Evelyn were able &nbsp;to give smallpox vaccinations to all the children.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">After the vaccinations, the youngsters stood around silently &nbsp;waiting for something to happen. It did, but it took a while. On our next visit we found that all the vaccinations had first patient was Jesusa &nbsp;Salinas, reported to be &nbsp;last of Aymara, we gave them bright-colored, hand-operated, plastic record &nbsp;players donated by International Educational Recordings. One man &nbsp;played the vinyl record over and over, amazed he could hear the little machine speak in his own language. Children peered through the clear plastic records, astonished that the machine could talk and they could understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Missionary Bill Jamerson had a conta gious enthusiasm, and even &nbsp;though the children did not&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">77</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">understand him when he spoke, they followed him around the island. &nbsp;When Carlos was busy translating for me, Bill used a picture roll to tell &nbsp;Bible stories. The youngsters, unable to understand his Spanish, kept &nbsp;their eyes glued to the pictures.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Bill tried to teach them a Christian song in Spanish. What we &nbsp;heard sounded more like moaning and groaning of animals than any &nbsp;singing I&rsquo;d ever heard before. And the tune&mdash;each one had their own, &nbsp;all different&mdash;but they did show enthusiasm. One small girl sitting &nbsp;next to Bill&rsquo;s knee sang with all her heart. Parents and grandparents &nbsp;stood around, appearing very proud of the noise their youngsters &nbsp;were making.<br />
As we began gathering up the medical equipment, someone came &nbsp;from the other side of the island reporting that an old man was dying &nbsp;inside his little reed hut. He had been too sick to get up when the rest &nbsp;of the people came for medical treatment.<br />
Some men managed to place this emaciated Uro on a poncho &nbsp;in front of his hut, and Bill went to work. He was worried though. &nbsp;&ldquo;Whatever I do,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this man will probably die, and the supersti tious people will blame us.&rdquo; We prayed, and Bill worked. Evelyn gave &nbsp;the man an injection. God worked a miracle.<br />
The next time Evelyn and I returned to visit the Uros, the old man &nbsp;had just come back from fishing. The long poles never reappeared, &nbsp;and the people never failed to ask, &ldquo;When is Doctor Jamerson coming&nbsp;<br />
78</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">back to visit us?&rdquo; Although he was not a physician, Bill had done the &nbsp;best he could with his experience as an army medic and the help of a &nbsp;registered nurse.<br />
The barriers of fear had been broken, and we returned frequently &nbsp;to the now friendly floating islands. Many times we took bread, which &nbsp;proved a welcome change for people who had little else to eat but fish. &nbsp;On one trip, we gave out clothing that had been donated by friends in &nbsp;the United States through an organization now called ADRA. If the &nbsp;Uros&rsquo; children wore clothes at all, it was usually a flour sack with holes &nbsp;cut out for the head and arms to go through.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">The Uros needed help, and we were able to serve them in many &nbsp;ways&mdash;medical care, food, clothing&mdash;yet all this was only temporary. &nbsp;&ldquo;What they need most,&rdquo; I told my wife, &ldquo;is to learn to help themselves. &nbsp;They need Christian education.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos accompanied us on every trip to the floating islands. Before &nbsp;leaving the Uros one day, I asked them if they would like to have a &nbsp;school where their children could learn to read and write. Carlos &nbsp;translated my words into Aymara. There was an enthusiastic response &nbsp;which I could not understand.<br />
Carlos said, &ldquo;Yes, they want a school for their children.&rdquo; He was &nbsp;lying, but I didn&rsquo;t know it.<br />
79</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Excited with what I thought was a favorable response, we made &nbsp;plans for a floating school, telling everyone we knew about the need. &nbsp;Friends donated money, and the Mission set aside funds for the &nbsp;project. We contacted administrators at the Southern Peru Copper &nbsp;Corporation&rsquo;s mine at Toquepala. They shipped a truckload of empty &nbsp;fifty-five gallon steel drums to the Mission. These could be welded together and painted with rust-resistant paint to form the necessary float &nbsp;for the school.<br />
By this time, my wife and I had spent five years living near the &nbsp;shores of Lake Titicaca in Puno, Peru. Just before the time for our fur lough to the United States in August 1961, the Lake Titicaca Mission &nbsp;of Seventh-day Adventists formally decided to build a floating school &nbsp;for the Uros living on the floating islands.<br />
The new Mission president, Don Sullivan, who took my place, and &nbsp;fellow missionaries Lloyd Cleveland, Herman Guy, and later, Harold &nbsp;Burden, began to carry out the plan. Mission treasurer Lloyd Cleveland &nbsp;directed the construction. Don Nelson, an ophthalmologist living in &nbsp;California, donated his cabin cruiser, which made frequent mission &nbsp;trips to the floating islands possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Carlos Velasquez, Mission custodian and interpreter on all our &nbsp;trips, volunteered to be the teacher at the new school. He had learned &nbsp;to love the Uros and wanted the chance to meet the challenge of helping&nbsp;<br />
80</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">these people find a better way of life. I did not realize that he had an other reason for volunteering for the job as well.<br />
The floating school was officially dedicated on November 7, 1963, &nbsp;in the presence of the Peruvian government inspector of education. &nbsp;It is now an officially accredited school in Peru. The Uro Indians may &nbsp;remain fishermen for a long time to come, but one thing is sure&mdash;they &nbsp;are happier fishermen. Education has helped them avoid many of the &nbsp;diseases that in the old days killed so many of their tribe. They have a &nbsp;reason to live.<br />
During a recent visit to Peru, I spent several days talking with &nbsp;Carlos to get the true story of the floating school and learned that mis sionaries like me don&rsquo;t always get the story right. He gave me many &nbsp;details I would not have known. For instance, I thought Carlos was not &nbsp;only volunteering but also happy about teaching in a floating school. &nbsp;Don Sullivan, who came after me as president of the Mission, be lieved the same thing and actually gave Carlos the official call to teach &nbsp;the Uros.<br />
In our recent conversation, Carlos asked, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember I &nbsp;told you I was afraid to live with the Uros for fear of lightning strikes?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I vaguely remember,&rdquo; I responded.&nbsp;<br />
He continued, &ldquo;The truth is, I did not want to go to the Uros and &nbsp;looked for any excuse not to go. You checked with technicians and told &nbsp;me there would be no lightning problem in a building with a corru gated iron roof and siding attached to floating steel drums.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Carlos,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if I told you this, someone must have given me &nbsp;this information.&rdquo;<br />
The issue came up when Carlos told me the Uros threatened to kill &nbsp;him when he first arrived to live on the floating island of Torani Pata. &nbsp;I could not understand. &ldquo;Carlos,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;why would they ask for a &nbsp;school and then try to exterminate the teacher?&rdquo;<br />
He looked me in the eye. &ldquo;Remember what I said when you asked &nbsp;the Uros if they would like to have a school? Well, they actually said, &nbsp;&lsquo;No, never! We don&rsquo;t want a school!&rsquo; I lied. I translated back to you say ing, &lsquo;Yes, we would like to have a school.&rsquo; &rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
I could hardly believe my ears. I had always trusted Carlos. &nbsp;Questions flooded my mind. Would there have been a floating school &nbsp;if Carlos had told me the truth? Where did things go wrong? Why does &nbsp;Carlos say he didn&rsquo;t want to teach at the floating islands when he showed &nbsp;so much interest in helping these people?<br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size:26px;">Chapter 3: Song of Songs</span></strong></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">The Spanish conquerors, the conquistadors, brought the Catholic religion to the Inca Empire in the Andes. Quechua &nbsp;and Aymara Indians like Carlos&rsquo;s parents assimilated into the &nbsp;new religion while keeping their own. This led to a strange mixture &nbsp;of Christianity and paganism. Carlos&rsquo;s parents, like their neighbors, &nbsp;venerated the saints, had their children baptized as infants, took part &nbsp;in the church&rsquo;s feast days, and attended Mass. At the same time, they &nbsp;worshiped the sun, held to the superstitions of their fathers, prayed to &nbsp;the spirits, and practiced witchcraft.<br />
While studying in Puno, Carlos learned to sing to the Virgin &nbsp;Mary, recite the Rosary, repeat the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, and study from a cat echism. He became puzzled when a biology teacher taught that men &nbsp;and women descended from monkeys over long periods of time. This &nbsp;is garbage, he thought. Inca legends make much more sense. Inti, the sun &nbsp;god, and Mama Quilla, the moon god, brought their children, Manco &nbsp;Capac and Mama Ocllo, out of Lake Titicaca to form the Incas.<br />
After school one day, a group of older boys approached Carlos. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to serenade girls tonight. Why don&rsquo;t you come along?&rdquo; &nbsp;Surprised to be invited since he was only fifteen, Carlos thought, This &nbsp;is great. I see pretty girls in my class, but I&rsquo;m too scared to talk to them.<br />
&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; he said. The boys waited until it was time &nbsp;for the girls to be in bed before they started out. Standing next to a &nbsp;house, they sang old-fashioned love songs. After they sang for a while, &nbsp;girls on the second floor opened a window and stuck their heads out, &nbsp;smiling and waving. This is exciting, Carlos thought. I wish we knew &nbsp;more songs.<br />
A few days later, a priest walked into a religion class and held up &nbsp;a book Carlos had never seen before. &ldquo;This is a Bible,&rdquo; the priest an nounced as he turned the pages. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s made up of the Old and New &nbsp;Testaments. There&rsquo;s the Law and the Prophets. These record the history&nbsp;<br />
29</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">of God&rsquo;s people from the beginning of the world until just before Jesus &nbsp;was born in Bethlehem.&rdquo;<br />
Boring, Carlos thought, but the priest kept right on talking. &nbsp;&ldquo;What we call the Old Testament also contains the Psalms, Proverbs, &nbsp;Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Solomon. Listen to this.&rdquo; The priest paused &nbsp;and began to read. &ldquo;The song of songs, which is Solomon&rsquo;s&rdquo; (Song of &nbsp;Solomon 1:1).<br />
Song of Songs! It hit Carlos like a lightning strike. Suddenly he be came interested in the Bible. I&rsquo;ve got to get this book. With the &ldquo;Song of &nbsp;Songs&rdquo; we could have a lot more fun serenading girls.<br />
He approached the priest at the close of class. &ldquo;I want to buy a &nbsp;Bible,&rdquo; he said.<br />
The priest smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but we don&rsquo;t have Bibles for sale.&rdquo; &nbsp;Disappointed, Carlos walked back toward his room on Calle de la &nbsp;Libertad. He whistled when two attractive girls crossed the street. &nbsp;He knew their names but kept his distance and didn&rsquo;t talk to them. &nbsp;Occasionally he waved at girls at soccer games. He liked them all but &nbsp;didn&rsquo;t have any special girl friends.<br />
Song of Songs! He thought about it walking down the street. Back &nbsp;in his room, he couldn&rsquo;t get it out of his head. It whirled around in his &nbsp;brain while he worked. He still thought about it while wrapped in wool &nbsp;blankets lying on the dirt floor, trying to go to sleep.&nbsp;<br />
Song of Songs! It flashed into his mind when he got dressed the &nbsp;next morning. He dreamed about it at school. Every day&mdash;the same &nbsp;thought. I&rsquo;ve got to get a Bible. I want to learn the Song of Songs. He &nbsp;went to a bookstore, but they had no Bibles. He asked friends where &nbsp;he could buy a Bible, but no one knew. It was becoming an obsession.<br />
The school year ended, and Carlos went home for summer vaca tion. His desire to purchase a Bible weighed on his mind, but he did &nbsp;not mention it to his parents. Rather than waste time going to Sunday &nbsp;markets, he preferred to stay on the farm and watch sheep. &ldquo;Mercados are boring,&rdquo; he always said.<br />
Where can I get a Bible? he still wondered often. I need the Song of &nbsp;Songs&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got to find a Bible. Early one Sunday, he walked across the &nbsp;pampa toward Plater&iacute;a. Why am I doing this? he thought. I hate mar kets. Something seemed to be pushing him.<br />
Feeling lonely, since all his friends were in Puno, Carlos walked &nbsp;around the Plater&iacute;a market. Merchandise of every kind was on display, &nbsp;but nothing interested him. A man selling books caught his attention.<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">He walked closer. His eyes were drawn to a black book with gold let ters. He stood and stared. Holy Bible! He wanted to shout, Is this the &nbsp;book the priest told us about?<br />
He approached the vendor. &ldquo;Sir, does this book contain the Song &nbsp;of Songs?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, it has sixty-six different books, including the Song of Songs.&rdquo; Carlos asked, &ldquo;How much does it cost?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain. You can buy it for sixty centavos.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos searched through his pockets. Amazing, he mused. I&rsquo;ve got &nbsp;exactly sixty centavos. I can&rsquo;t wait to get back to school and serenade the &nbsp;girls. How will they react when we sing the Song of Songs?<br />
Thoughts of smiling girls waving from second-floor windows &nbsp;raced through Carlos&rsquo;s mind. I don&rsquo;t want anyone seeing me buy a Bible. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll just stand here until the people move on by.<br />
At last, no one was around except the book seller. Carlos handed &nbsp;the man sixty centavos, took the Bible, and hid it under his clothes. He &nbsp;walked away from the plaza and out into the pampa. Finally, with no &nbsp;one near, he stopped, pulled out the book and started looking for the &nbsp;Song of Songs, as the Song of Solomon is called in most Spanish versions of the Bible.<br />
What&rsquo;s wrong? The vendor said this book has the Song of Songs, but &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t find it. Carlos was getting desperate until he found the index. &nbsp;Whew, it&rsquo;s here. It does have the Song of Songs.<br />
Quickly he looked up the page number and began to read. What? I &nbsp;don&rsquo;t see any song. He scanned through all eight chapters. These are not &nbsp;songs to serenade girls! Big mistake. I wasted my money.<br />
During the summer at home, Carlos became curious and began &nbsp;looking at the Bible when no one was around. He read how God made &nbsp;the world in six days. That makes sense, he thought. My biology teacher &nbsp;needs to read this.<br />
Wanting to know more about the Bible, Carlos kept reading, but he &nbsp;didn&rsquo;t understand much of it. I need someone to teach me, he thought. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s time to register for school. There&rsquo;s a school in Chullunquiani where &nbsp;they teach Bible. That&rsquo;s where I should go.<br />
For no particular reason, Carlos went to visit a maternal cousin &nbsp;named Yupanqui, whose father was an Adventista. Alone at home, the &nbsp;cousin invited Carlos to come in. The boys chatted about their sum mer work on their parents&rsquo; farms. Looking around the room, Carlos &nbsp;noticed some magazines. The Spanish title of one, La Luz de los Andes<br />
31</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">(Light of the Andes), grabbed his attention. Carlos picked it up and &nbsp;began browsing.<br />
&ldquo;Where did you get this?&rdquo; he asked.<br />
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s published by a school at Chullunquiani.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I see it advertises Colegio del Lago Titicaca. Where is this school?&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than fifty miles away, on the other side of Juliaca.&rdquo; Carlos looked at his cousin and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Chullunquiani. &nbsp;I want to attend this school.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You go to Chullunquiani?&rdquo; His cousin laughed. &ldquo;What will you do &nbsp;there? It&rsquo;s not like Colegio San Carlos. The people there are Adventista Christians. They study the Bible. They pray and sing. Do you know &nbsp;how to sing hymns?&rdquo;<br />
A moment later, Yupanqui added, &ldquo;My father wants me to go to a &nbsp;Christian school, but I&rsquo;m not ready for that.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky,&rdquo; Carlos said. &ldquo;My parents want nothing to do with &nbsp;Adventista schools.&rdquo; He thought for a minute. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made up my mind. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to Chullunquiani.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos forgot all about the Song of Songs and began dreaming &nbsp;about Chullunquiani. Walking along the stony trail back to his home &nbsp;in Ccota, his mind focused on Chullunquiani. At home that evening&mdash; Chullunquiani. When he got up in the morning&mdash;Chullunquiani. All &nbsp;day long he kept thinking, I&rsquo;ve got to go to Chullunquiani.<br />
It was early March and time for Carlos to register for classes. His &nbsp;parents&rsquo; home had been enlarged, and they had their own little bed room. Because of the chilling cold in the Peruvian highlands, Aymaras &nbsp;went to bed early. Carlos walked into the bedroom. &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I &nbsp;want to study at Chullunquiani.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; his father growled. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t going to Chullunquiani! &nbsp;Those people are Adventistas. They sing a lot at that school. Do I sing? &nbsp;Does your mother sing? Do you know how to sing? It&rsquo;s no place for you.&rdquo;<br />
Chullunquiani! My parents won&rsquo;t let me go, Carlos thought. With eyes fixed on his parents, the firstborn son spoke po litely. &ldquo;Thank you, Papa. Thank you, Mama. Since I&rsquo;m not going to &nbsp;Chullunquiani, I&rsquo;ve decided not to study anymore. I&rsquo;m grown up, so &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll find a job and work. I finished primary school and have a year of &nbsp;secondary. I&rsquo;m going to Arequipa to get a job and earn money. I&rsquo;ll leave &nbsp;at midnight tonight.&rdquo;<br />
His stunned parents listened in silence. Why is Carlos so rash? his &nbsp;father thought. Troubled thoughts filled the mind of Emilio Velasquez.<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">I wanted my son to be a witch doctor. We sacrificed to send him to Puno &nbsp;to get an education, and now he wants to go to Chullunquiani. My par ents rightly refused the message of Stahl. Why would my firstborn want &nbsp;to get mixed up with that crazy religion?<br />
The angry father sat up and shouted, &ldquo;Get out of here! Go to bed!&rdquo; Respectfully, Carlos stepped closer to his parents and repeated &nbsp;words of appreciation. &ldquo;Thank you, Papa. Thank you, Mama. You&rsquo;ve &nbsp;helped me a lot. I know how to take care of myself. I&rsquo;ll be OK. I&rsquo;m going &nbsp;to Arequipa. You won&rsquo;t need to worry about me.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos turned and walked back to his own bed. It&rsquo;s going to be dif ficult, he realized. There are no cars or buses, and I can&rsquo;t afford the train. &nbsp;Oh well, a chullo and poncho will keep me warm. I&rsquo;ll walk across the &nbsp;Andes and get to Arequipa with no problem.<br />
As he thought about the plans he had announced to his parents, &nbsp;he began to wonder, What have I done now? I told them I&rsquo;m leaving. &nbsp;Should I go or should I stay? To start out walking to Arequipa tonight &nbsp;might not be too smart.<br />
Carlos&rsquo;s active mind searched for a better solution. I know, he thought. I&rsquo;ll go to Puno, work a month, and buy a train ticket to &nbsp;Arequipa. While looking for a better job, I can sell water. Puno has two &nbsp;public fountains. The best one is behind the cathedral. Hardly anyone has &nbsp;running water, so I&rsquo;ll sell buckets of water.<br />
Carlos jumped up and put on his poncho. He got a little food to gether. Now I&rsquo;m ready. I&rsquo;ll lie down and rest until midnight. Since I know &nbsp;Puno well, this will work out fine. And when I get to Arequipa, I can start &nbsp;a new life.<br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size:26px;">Chapter 7: What Will They Say?</span></strong></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">Carlos struggled with his thoughts. Why do I have to wait two days for an answer from Naomi&rsquo;s parents? He had been out of &nbsp;the army for a year, and he had just accepted a position as &nbsp;principal of Colegio Fernando Stahl in Plater&iacute;a. It&rsquo;s going to be a big &nbsp;responsibility, he realized. Some of the teachers are married, and I would &nbsp;like to be married by the end of the year.<br />
Two days seemed like an eternity. Why didn&rsquo;t Naomi&rsquo;s parents make &nbsp;an immediate decision like mine did?<br />
Father, mother, and son arrived back at the grandmother&rsquo;s home &nbsp;on the evening of the second day. She immediately called Naomi&rsquo;s fa ther and stepmother. The father faced the Velasquez family and spoke. &nbsp;&ldquo;We think it will be all right, but . . .&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;What kind of wed ding will you have?&rdquo;<br />
Emilio thought for a moment before answering. &ldquo;Your daughter &nbsp;and our son are both Adventistas. Our son wants to have a Christian &nbsp;wedding. There will be no dancing, no band, and no alcohol. After the &nbsp;legal ceremony there will be a formal wedding in the church.&rdquo;<br />
Naomi&rsquo;s father responded, &ldquo;This is not what we want, but my mother &nbsp;is an Adventista too, so it will be all right.&rdquo; They discussed more details, &nbsp;and both families agreed to go ahead with plans for the marriage.<br />
Carlos, feeling excited about the prospect of getting married, ac companied his parents back home. &ldquo;Thank you for letting God choose &nbsp;for me,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s His plan for me to marry Naomi. It&rsquo;s &nbsp;an answer to my prayer.&rdquo;<br />
As they walked, he thought about his family&rsquo;s history. My grand parents refused to accept the gospel of Jesus, and they forced my parents &nbsp;to marry. They didn&rsquo;t learn to really love each other until they became &nbsp;Christians. With God&rsquo;s help, I will have a happy marriage from the start.<br />
Carlos had never seen a Christian wedding, so he went to the &nbsp;home of the Mission president in Puno. &ldquo;Pastor Krause,&rdquo; he began.&nbsp;<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;You know I will be working in Plater&iacute;a. I don&rsquo;t have any money right &nbsp;now, but I will save a little each month, as I plan to be married at the &nbsp;end of the school year. We want to have a church wedding. What do I &nbsp;need to do? What kind of ceremony should we have?&rdquo;<br />
Pastor Krause asked, &ldquo;Have you discussed the marriage with your &nbsp;parents? This is the first step you should take.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, our families have gotten together, and everyone has agreed &nbsp;for us to marry.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; the pastor said. &ldquo;Another important point is your conduct. &nbsp;Here in the Altiplano it&rsquo;s the custom for couples to live together before &nbsp;they are married. Bible-believing Christians must follow God&rsquo;s Word &nbsp;and refrain from relations before marriage. Only after the wedding will &nbsp;the husband and wife sleep together.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos replied, &ldquo;Yes, we want to keep ourselves pure and set &nbsp;the right example for my students and our friends and neighbors. &nbsp;I read the book The Adventist Home. God wants us to hold to the &nbsp;highest standards.&rdquo;<br />
The pastor continued, &ldquo;When you are ready to be married, you will &nbsp;take your parents with you to the mayor&rsquo;s office for a legal marriage. &nbsp;But remember, in the sight of God you are not married yet. Next you &nbsp;will go to the church. We will have a simple ceremony, reading texts &nbsp;from the Bible, and you and your bride will publicly declare your love &nbsp;for each other. We will then declare you husband and wife and pray for &nbsp;God&rsquo;s blessing on your home.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Is that all, pastor?&rdquo; Carlos asked.<br />
&ldquo;You will probably want to have a reception, inviting all your &nbsp;friends and neighbors. Remember, though, that you will not be serv ing alcohol and there will be no worldly music or dancing. It can be a &nbsp;time of rejoicing, but not a time of frivolity. Jesus performed His first &nbsp;miracle at a wedding feast. God will bless your wedding.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank you, pastor. We will follow your counsel.&rdquo;<br />
The new school year began, and Carlos found that being princi pal of the school, besides teaching as well, kept him extremely busy. &nbsp;Each month he put aside money to pay for the wedding. The ceremony &nbsp;would take place when school was out in December. Naomi, wanting &nbsp;to surprise Carlos, made her own wedding dress from white sheets.&nbsp;<br />
What originally seemed to be an eternity to Carlos turned out to &nbsp;be like a moment. The day for the December wedding arrived, and &nbsp;Carlos used some of the money he had saved to pay for a car to take his<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">bride and her family to the mayor in Acora. He paid the fees and soon &nbsp;had the legal marriage document in his hands.<br />
The hired car then took them directly to Plater&iacute;a, where a church &nbsp;full of people waited.<br />
Carlos, dressed in a black suit, stood with the pastor and watched &nbsp;as his lovely bride, dressed in the white gown she had made from &nbsp;sheets, walked down the aisle. The minister talked about God&rsquo;s plan for &nbsp;marriage. The couple knelt for prayer, and then they stood while the &nbsp;pastor smiled and said, &ldquo;In harmony with the laws of Peru and God&rsquo;s &nbsp;plan for marriage, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Ladies and &nbsp;gentleman, I present Mr. and Mrs. Velasquez.&rdquo;<br />
The ceremony had been sacred and simple. Many who were see ing a church wedding for the first time said it was beautiful. Others &nbsp;complained because there was no drinking or dancing, but many of the &nbsp;young people said, &ldquo;This is the kind of wedding we want to have when &nbsp;we get married. We want our home to be blessed by God.&rdquo; A reception &nbsp;was held at the home of an Adventist church member in the pampa.<br />
The newly married couple spent their honeymoon visiting &nbsp;churches around the Plater&iacute;a Mission Station. Each day they gave Bible &nbsp;studies to new people and visited families of church members to en courage them. Since school was out, the Mission, wanting to give the &nbsp;couple a little financial help, hired Carlos to do this work during the &nbsp;summer. The newlyweds worked together, visiting, praying, and study ing with families.<br />
After three months of marriage, Carlos accepted an invita tion to teach at a mission school in Caijano Pata, where everyone &nbsp;spoke Quechua. However, Naomi&rsquo;s happiness at being the wife of an &nbsp;Adventist teacher received a terrible blow the day they arrived at the &nbsp;place of their new assignment. They had brought a bed and a few other &nbsp;belongings. Like any good wife, Naomi asked, &ldquo;Where are we going to &nbsp;live?&rdquo; There was no place for them to live. Finally a kind church mem ber who worked at home as a tailor offered them one small room with &nbsp;a dirt floor. Together they set up the bed, and they used boxes to store &nbsp;a few belongings.<br />
The next morning Carlos met the school board chairman. &ldquo;Sir, I &nbsp;would like to see the school.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Before we look at the school,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I want you to know &nbsp;there is a government school about half a mile away. They&rsquo;ve caused us &nbsp;all kind of problems.&rdquo;<br />
59</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, and the only way to get along is to fight them. It&rsquo;s a one teacher school with a woman in charge.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; Carlos said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come here to fight our neighbors. I&rsquo;m &nbsp;here to help people. We need to learn to get along. I will do my best to &nbsp;make friends. Let&rsquo;s go visit this teacher. &rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No way, Se&ntilde;or Velasquez. You can go by yourself if you want.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid. I&rsquo;ll go right now. The Bible says, &lsquo;If it is pos sible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men&rsquo; &rdquo; &nbsp;[Romans 12:18].<br />
Carlos left for the neighboring government school, wondering &nbsp;what could possibly have happened to cause a fight. He had no idea of &nbsp;the tension that existed between the Adventist group and the commu nity. Arriving at the government school, he introduced himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m &nbsp;Carlos Velasquez.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And what are you doing here?&rdquo; the teacher asked.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the new teacher in Caijano Pata.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking with you,&rdquo; she said as she looked down. &ldquo;Profesora! Listen! I&rsquo;m not here to fight with anyone. We want to be &nbsp;friends. I&rsquo;d like to help you any way we can. We want to do whatever we &nbsp;can for the good of the community.&rdquo;<br />
The woman&rsquo;s attitude changed. &ldquo;This is wonderful,&rdquo; she said as a &nbsp;smile crept across her face.<br />
Carlos responded, &ldquo;If there is any way I can help you, please let me &nbsp;know.&rdquo;<br />
They shook hands, and Carlos hurried back to the school board &nbsp;chairman. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see the school.&rdquo; He called Naomi, &nbsp;and they went together. Arriving at the site, they looked in amazement. &nbsp;All they saw was four adobe walls and a dirt floor. No roof, no doors, &nbsp;no windows, and no desks.<br />
The board chairman explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. We don&rsquo;t know what to &nbsp;do. Enemies of the church burned our thatched-roof school.&rdquo; &nbsp;Carlos looked in disbelief. Naomi was perplexed. &ldquo;Why did the &nbsp;Mission send us here?&rdquo; she asked.<br />
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Carlos responded. &ldquo;God knows. I&rsquo;m sure there are &nbsp;boys and girls here who need a Christian education.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos contacted parents and began raising money. He bought &nbsp;lumber, corrugated tin roofing, windows, and a door. Carlos and &nbsp;Naomi worked on the school building with volunteers. Some of the<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Catholic neighbors came to help. They even built wood tables to use &nbsp;for desks. In just a few days, they were ready for classes to begin. &nbsp;The one-room school opened with thirty children in grades one &nbsp;to four. They studied subjects required by the government, plus Bible, &nbsp;which Carlos made attractive to the children. He played with the stu dents at recess time. Having promised to be a friend of the teacher &nbsp;at the government school, occasionally he went and played with the &nbsp;children there.<br />
School went well. Parents and students were happy. There was no &nbsp;problem with the public school, and even the government education &nbsp;inspector seemed pleased when he came to visit. The newlyweds used &nbsp;up all their money, expecting to receive Carlos&rsquo;s salary at the end of the &nbsp;month. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Velasquez,&rdquo; the board chairman said, &ldquo;we regret it very &nbsp;much, but there is no money for your salary.&rdquo;<br />
He went on to explain. &ldquo;The people here are very poor, and since &nbsp;they gave everything they had to rebuild the burned-out school, noth ing is left to pay their children&rsquo;s tuition.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
Outrageous, Carlos thought. Unbelievable! We should pack up and &nbsp;go home. We&rsquo;ve spent everything we have. We don&rsquo;t even have money to &nbsp;get home.<br />
Naomi saw their predicament. &ldquo;The children like you, Carlos. We &nbsp;came here to teach them about Jesus, and we can&rsquo;t let them down. We &nbsp;have no money, and there&rsquo;s nothing to cook. I&rsquo;m going out to work with &nbsp;people in the harvest.&rdquo;<br />
For one day&rsquo;s work Naomi received twenty-five pounds of pota toes. Without kerosene to use the primus they received as a wedding &nbsp;gift, Naomi gathered sheep chips for fuel to boil potatoes. With nothing &nbsp;else, they ate potatoes three times a day&mdash;potatoes and more potatoes.<br />
At the end of first month&mdash;no salary. Second month&mdash;no salary. &nbsp;Third month&mdash;no salary. Halfway through the school year someone &nbsp;gave them five soles. Later someone gave them ten soles. Another &nbsp;month passed, and they received fifteen soles. When they finally got &nbsp;forty soles, they felt wealthy.<br />
They learned to love these poor Quechua brothers and sisters, but &nbsp;at the end of the year they sadly told them, &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be able to come &nbsp;back next year.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos pondered, Whoever dreamed I would not get my salary? My &nbsp;wife is an amazing missionary. Instead of complaining, she went out and &nbsp;worked in the fields to get us a little food. Without her, I would have<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">become totally discouraged. But now, what am I going to do? We have no &nbsp;money to get home.<br />
One church member took pity and offered to lend them a burro to &nbsp;take their bed and other things as far as Juliaca. The family who shared &nbsp;a room with them saw their desperate situation and gave them five &nbsp;soles to take the train from Juliaca to Puno. Tickets for two cost three &nbsp;soles. With the remaining two soles they rode on the back of a truck all &nbsp;the way to their home in Ccota.<br />
Reflecting on their first year of marriage, Carlos said, &ldquo;You know, &nbsp;Naomi, I never received a salary, we nearly starved to death, but thanks &nbsp;to you, God saw us through. The potatoes you got for working saved &nbsp;our lives. It&rsquo;s time to think seriously about our future.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;What do you think we should do, Carlos?&rdquo; Naomi questioned. &ldquo;We both need more education. I&rsquo;ve prayed about it, and I think &nbsp;we should go to Cusco. I can work in the daytime and study at night to &nbsp;complete secondary. After our experience in rebuilding the school at &nbsp;Caijano Pata, I&rsquo;d like to learn practical things about construction. I&rsquo;ve &nbsp;noticed that few women around Lake Titicaca know how to sew. You &nbsp;could study dressmaking.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Carlos, that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do. I&rsquo;d love to teach &nbsp;women to sew. It would be a blessing for poor families.&rdquo;<br />

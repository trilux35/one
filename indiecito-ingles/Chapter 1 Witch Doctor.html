<p><strong><span style="font-size:26px;">Chapter 1: Witch Doctor?</span></strong></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">It&rsquo;s just a stupid American custom,&rdquo; Carlos insisted. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t wear&nbsp;<br />
a necktie.&rdquo; The young man stood upright, with his eyes glued to &nbsp;mine, as he spoke.<br />
Who does this Aymara Indian think he is, anyway? I thought. I&rsquo;ve &nbsp;just explained that he will represent our Mission better if he wears a tie. My wife and I were new missionaries in the Lake Titicaca Mission, &nbsp;located at 12,500 feet elevation in the Andes of Peru. Only weeks earlier, &nbsp;I had been asked to serve as president of the Mission. We had been im pressed with Carlos Velasquez. Despite being the lowest-paid worker &nbsp;in the office, he quietly performed every task he was asked to do. Now what&rsquo;s going on? I wondered. He&rsquo;s never spoken out like this &nbsp;before. Immediately I wanted to know more about a young man who &nbsp;refused to wear a necktie. Why is he so unyielding in standing up for &nbsp;his convictions?<br />
Chilling wind whipped across the pampa near Lake Titicaca&rsquo;s &nbsp;shore just before dawn. It rattled the only window in the one-room &nbsp;thatched adobe hut built by Emilio and Ignacia Velasquez. Above the &nbsp;noise, they heard a faint knock, knock, knock.<br />
Emilio opened the door, and a neighbor woman entered. &ldquo;Are you &nbsp;all right?&rdquo; she asked. Ignacia had suffered intense labor pains most of &nbsp;the night. After lighting a candle in the predawn darkness, the neigh bor pointed to an almanac hanging on the adobe wall, which the il literate Velasquez family could not read. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the day of San Carlos,&rdquo; &nbsp;she announced.<br />
Breathing heavily, Ignacia gasped for air as the pains became &nbsp;stronger and more frequent. Suddenly a baby began to cry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boy!&rdquo; &nbsp;the neighbor woman exclaimed.<br />
Emilio moved close to Ignacia. &ldquo;The farthest mountain we see &nbsp;from our home here in Ccota is Carlos Anuni,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We often&nbsp;<br />
13</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">pray to spirits hanging around this mountain. Let&rsquo;s name our &nbsp;son Carlos!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes! Yes!&rdquo; the new mother whispered. &ldquo;Carlos is a good name for &nbsp;a boy born on the day of San Carlos.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
Soon after sunrise, Emilio, with a wad of coca in his mouth and a &nbsp;small bag of dried coca leaves in his hand, stood alone in the adobe walled patio, looking toward the distant peak of Carlos Anuni. &ldquo;Spirits &nbsp;of the mountain,&rdquo; he intoned, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be a witch doctor.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
Emilio paused while strange thoughts raced around in his head. &nbsp;Why am I so obsessed with witchcraft? I was disgusted when our witch &nbsp;doctor lived with two different women. That wretched man went back &nbsp;and forth from one woman to the other and ended up getting exactly &nbsp;what he deserved. Dogs came and ate his body after he died out on &nbsp;the pampa.<br />
Emilio continued his intonation. &ldquo;I like it when spirits come to our &nbsp;home and speak Aymara.&rdquo; Still facing the mountain, the new father &nbsp;opened the dirty cloth bag he was holding. Falling to his knees, he &nbsp;slowly placed twelve coca leaves on a cold, flat stone. &ldquo;I dedicate my &nbsp;son Carlos to the spirits. Make him the witch doctor I wanted to be.&rdquo;<br />
A few days later, when Ignacia felt better, she collected the finest &nbsp;products from their little farm&mdash;barley, quinoa, round cheese cakes, &nbsp;and eggs. &ldquo;Emilio,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we want the best for Carlos. He needs to &nbsp;be baptized.&rdquo;<br />
The two superstitious spirit worshipers trudged across the pampa &nbsp;to the village of Acora. Finding the priest, they presented their produce &nbsp;as a gift. &ldquo;Please baptize baby Carlos at the altar in the Church of San &nbsp;Pedro,&rdquo; they requested.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do this for fifty soles,&rdquo; the priest replied, &ldquo;but first you must &nbsp;find someone to be the godfather.&rdquo; At Emilio&rsquo;s pleading, Se&ntilde;or Cecilio &nbsp;Mart&iacute;nez agreed to be godfather and witness, but there was a catch. &nbsp;Indians were often exploited by land owners. For this favor, Emilio &nbsp;agreed to spend time working on the wealthy man&rsquo;s hacienda. After &nbsp;the baptism by sprinkling, the humble parents registered the birth of &nbsp;their son at the town hall.<br />
Eighteen years before Carlos&rsquo;s birth, an Aymara chief, Manuel &nbsp;Camacho, began studying the Bible. The Indian leader had learned &nbsp;to read while serving in the Peruvian army. Troubled that his people &nbsp;had been exploited by Spanish conquerors, he once led a group of<br />
14</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Indians to visit the president of Peru. Their request for schools fell on &nbsp;deaf ears.<br />
When Seventh-day Adventist literature left by Edward Thomann &nbsp;from Chile fell into the chief &rsquo;s hands, he found that it pointed to Jesus &nbsp;as the only solution to human problems. As Camacho read his Bible, &nbsp;the words of Jesus worked on his mind. &ldquo;Whatever you want men to &nbsp;do to you, do also to them&rdquo; (Matthew 7:12). No wealthy landlord would &nbsp;like to be treated the way they treat Indians, he thought.<br />
Searching for a better way of life for Aymaras living in the &nbsp;Altiplano, Camacho contacted the Adventist mission headquarters &nbsp;in Lima, asking for missionaries to come to Plater&iacute;a, a village directly &nbsp;across the windswept pampa from Carlos&rsquo;s home in Ccota. In response &nbsp;to Camacho&rsquo;s request, pioneer missionaries Ferdinand and Ana Stahl &nbsp;arrived in Plater&iacute;a in 1911.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to the wrong place to do missionary work,&rdquo; Ana &nbsp;complained to her husband when they first arrived in the bleak, cold &nbsp;Peruvian Altiplano. Chief Camacho volunteered to share his thatched &nbsp;adobe home in nearby Utawilaya with the couple while a mission &nbsp;house was being built in Plater&iacute;a. Then Ana realized, My first impres<br />
sions were wrong.<br />
Seeing firsthand the wretched condition of the Altiplano Indians &nbsp;living around Lake Titicaca, the Stahls concluded, God truly called &nbsp;us to teach a downtrodden race how to live better in this world and &nbsp;have hope of eternal life in heaven. They wrote how Indians were ex<br />
ploited by landowners, who frequently made virtual slaves of them by &nbsp;using alcohol and coca to keep them in a stupor. Living in absolute &nbsp;filth in tiny huts, the people never took a bath. Lice and fleas, along &nbsp;with rats and mice, infected nearly every dwelling. Clothes were worn &nbsp;without washing until they were completely worn out. Yellow fever, &nbsp;typhoid, smallpox, and tuberculosis were rampant. Sanitation and hy<br />
giene were unknown. Lack of education kept the Indian population &nbsp;in ignorance. Practicing witchcraft, the Indians lived in constant fear &nbsp;of spirits.<br />
Ana and Ferdinand Stahl, both trained as nurses, treated many &nbsp;diseases and taught the people to bathe, to stop chewing coca leaves, &nbsp;and to avoid the use of alcohol. When the Stahls started a school, 150 &nbsp;enrolled, including many adults who wanted to learn to read.&nbsp;<br />
One day in class, Pastor Stahl cracked an egg, put it in a glass, &nbsp;and poured alcohol over it. A bright fourteen-year-old boy, Luciano<br />
15</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">----</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Chambi, who knew a little Spanish, watched in amazement as the al cohol cooked the egg.<br />
If alcohol does this to an egg, what will it do to my stomach? he asked &nbsp;himself. Immediately he determined, I&rsquo;ll never drink alcohol! Thrilled &nbsp;with what he had learned about Christianity, Luciano went to live with &nbsp;the Stahls, where he became the voice of Pastor Stahl to the Indians, &nbsp;serving as his translator. With someone to take their poor Spanish and &nbsp;translate it into Aymara, Ferdinand and Ana visited every home in the &nbsp;area. They would take bread baked by Ana, sing, pray, and share the &nbsp;good news found in the Bible.<br />
Playful at times, Pastor Stahl liked to pick up the head of the &nbsp;house and twirl him around. The families would laugh, thinking, &nbsp;Compared with this tall gringo, we are like children. In spite of their &nbsp;poor Spanish, the Stahls&rsquo; sincere love and desire to help a needy race &nbsp;touched the hearts of the Aymaras. Hundreds attended the mission<br />
aries&rsquo; worship services, sent their children to mission schools, and &nbsp;joined in studying the Word of God. The Stahls were thrilled to see &nbsp;many accept Jesus and join them in looking forward to His return &nbsp;to earth.<br />
Carlos Velasquez&rsquo;s paternal grandparents, Ger&oacute;nimo and Pascuela &nbsp;Velasquez, instead of accepting what the Stahls had to say, listened to &nbsp;enemies of the missionaries who were saying, &ldquo;Those who join the &nbsp;Adventistas will become devils with horns and tails.&rdquo; When the Stahls &nbsp;visited the Velasquez home, they were turned away. The grandparents &nbsp;thought, We are fine the way we are. We own over a hundred sheep. We &nbsp;love our fiestas with music, dancing, and drinking. Chewing coca keeps &nbsp;us from feeling pain or cold. Alcohol makes us feel good.<br />
&ldquo;Pascuela,&rdquo; Ger&oacute;nimo said to his wife. &ldquo;This strong white man with &nbsp;strange blue eyes wants to change the way we live.&rdquo; They talked it over, &nbsp;making a firm decision. &ldquo;We will have nothing to do with the Stahls &nbsp;and their mission.&rdquo;<br />
Ger&oacute;nimo worked at home as a tailor, making shirts. He sold them &nbsp;in the plaza on market days. Pascuela and the children cared for their &nbsp;farm animals.<br />
Like their ancestors for hundreds of years, the parents chose the &nbsp;spouse for their children. Their son Emilio grew angry when he was &nbsp;told to marry Ignacia Miranda.<br />
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want this woman,&rdquo; he said, defying his parents. Don&rsquo;t they &nbsp;know there&rsquo;s a girl I would love to marry? Likewise, Ignacia turned bitter<br />
16</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">----</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">when her parents insisted she marry Emilio. She questioned, Why do &nbsp;my parents do this to me? I&rsquo;ve been making eyes at another young man. In spite of their protests, the two were taken to a priest and forced &nbsp;to marry. Nine months later, Ignacia gave birth to their first son, Carlos. &nbsp;Perhaps Ignacia is not as bad as I imagined, Emilio reasoned. At least &nbsp;she&rsquo;s given me a son.<br />
Carlitos, barely able to walk when he was a year old, went around &nbsp;calling &ldquo;mama&rdquo; and &ldquo;tata&rdquo; (Aymara for papa). Tribal custom demand ed that a boy wait until his first birthday to have a haircut. Then family &nbsp;and friends are invited for a celebration, and the hair is cut by some &nbsp;influential person.<br />
&ldquo;Ignacia,&rdquo; Emilio said. &ldquo;Our boy will grow up to be a witch doctor. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s have his hair cut by the famous witch doctor in Camacani.&rdquo; They prepared a large bag of coca leaves and a liter of alcohol for &nbsp;use in the boy&rsquo;s hair-cutting ceremony. The proud father invited neigh bors, friends, and family members to watch the witch doctor cut his &nbsp;son&rsquo;s hair. Everyone had a different idea of what Carlos would do when &nbsp;he grew up. For Emilio, there was only one possibility. My son will be a &nbsp;witch doctor like the man cutting his hair!<br />
By now, Carlos had a baby sister, Clara, who needed attention from &nbsp;her parents. Going out to work each morning, Mama and Papa hardly &nbsp;noticed when Carlitos developed a high fever. Ignacia carried Clara &nbsp;on her back, leaving little Carlos abandoned and alone at home. Each &nbsp;day he grew worse. The superstitious parents bathed him in urine and &nbsp;prayed to the spirits for healing.<br />
At the end of two weeks Carlos couldn&rsquo;t even say &ldquo;mama.&rdquo; Burning &nbsp;with fever, he simply lay in bed with his eyes closed. We&rsquo;ve got to do &nbsp;something, Emilio realized. After the first rooster crowed in the morn ing, the desperate father took a bottle of the boy&rsquo;s urine and hurried to &nbsp;the nearest witch doctor&rsquo;s home.<br />
The clever medicine man studied the contents of the bottle care fully. Finally, looking into the eyes of the anxious father, he said, &ldquo;You &nbsp;came too late. Your boy will die.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; Emilio exclaimed as tears flooded his eyes. &ldquo;You mean &nbsp;there&rsquo;s nothing you can do to save my son?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I said you came too late,&rdquo; the witch doctor growled. Pausing for &nbsp;a moment, he reached for a strange concoction in a bottle. &ldquo;Take this &nbsp;medicine and give it to your boy along with coca tea.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;You &nbsp;must pray to the spirits, because I can&rsquo;t help you anymore.&rdquo;<br />
17</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">The next Sunday morning, Carlos&rsquo;s parents left him at home with &nbsp;a cousin and walked to the market at the Acora plaza. His mother kept &nbsp;wondering, Will Carlitos die?<br />
The apprehensive parents bought a toy drum and a few oranges. &nbsp;Arriving home, they stood by Carlos and beat on the drum. For the &nbsp;first time in days, he opened his eyes. &ldquo;Boom! Boom! Boom!&rdquo; He imi tated the sound of the drum. &ldquo;Mama, I&rsquo;m hungry,&rdquo; he cried.<br />
His mother brought him a potato, which he quickly devoured. &nbsp;&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something you will like,&rdquo; Mama said and handed him a peeled &nbsp;orange. Smacking his lips, Carlos sat up. Oranges, carried up from the &nbsp;jungle, were rarely seen in the Velasquez home.<br />
&ldquo;The spirits worked a miracle!&rdquo; the parents declared when the fever &nbsp;vanished. &ldquo;Our son is learning to walk again.&rdquo; At first he went only &nbsp;a few steps, but each day as his strength increased, he walked more. &nbsp;Carlos, who was nearly dead, got well. However, many days with high &nbsp;fever left him with eye problems and a learning disability he would &nbsp;wrestle with for the rest of his life.<br />
No longer a happy child, Carlos slept a great deal, staying gloomy and &nbsp;sullen during long days of exceptionally heavy rain. Flood waters from &nbsp;Lake Titicaca reached the doorstep of the Velasquez hut. Carlos&rsquo;s mood &nbsp;brightened when the sun finally appeared. He took a small net and caught &nbsp;his first fish. Fascinated by the shore birds, he tried to imitate their sounds.<br />
Children in Peru&rsquo;s great Altiplano were given responsibility at an &nbsp;early age. On his third birthday, Emilio called, &ldquo;Carlitos, come!&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming, Papa,&rdquo; he said as he ran to his father.<br />
&ldquo;Carlos, you&rsquo;ll be a witch doctor when you grow up, but first you &nbsp;must learn to work. I want you to care for our pigs.&rdquo;<br />
Each morning, Carlos let ten dirty pigs out of their pen and led &nbsp;them out to the field, where he watched them all day. He had to be &nbsp;constantly alert to keep them from escaping. When a pig tried to get &nbsp;away, he hit it with a small stick, sending it squealing back to the rest of &nbsp;the herd. At the end of the year, the family celebrated by killing a male &nbsp;pig and drinking its warm, fresh blood.<br />
The Velasquez family watched Lake Titicaca&rsquo;s water level rise for &nbsp;months. &ldquo;The spirits are angry,&rdquo; Emilio declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen the &nbsp;lake so full. The water&rsquo;s all around our house. We&rsquo;ve got to move to &nbsp;higher ground.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Ignacia agreed. &ldquo;The bottoms of our adobe walls are soaked, &nbsp;and they will collapse.&rdquo;<br />
18</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Facing the need to move but with no place to go, the parents sent &nbsp;Carlos to live with his paternal grandparents in Palalla while they built &nbsp;a new hut on higher ground in Ccota. Years before, these grandparents &nbsp;rejected the teaching of Pastor and Mrs. Stahl and all they did to help &nbsp;Aymaras and Quechuas live a better life. The grandparents knew noth<br />
ing about cleanliness&mdash;never combed their hair or bathed. &nbsp;At home, Carlos had drunk pig blood. Now his diet was largely &nbsp;pork. He cringed when his grandfather spit on the wall. Worse, he &nbsp;often blew his nose, wiped the snot off with his hand and rubbed it on &nbsp;the wall. Why does he do this? Carlos questioned. It makes me sick to &nbsp;my stomach.<br />
Despite the disgusting habits, hidden away in the hearts of these &nbsp;primitive people were seeds of truth. Aymaras, predating the Incas, &nbsp;learned much from their captors. One day, grandmother Pascuela &nbsp;Quimachi de Velasquez called Carlos. &ldquo;You need to know what the &nbsp;Incas taught our ancestors,&rdquo; she said.<br />
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Carlos asked.<br />
&ldquo;They taught three important rules&mdash;&lsquo;Ama sua, ama lua, amaquella.&rsquo; &rdquo; &nbsp;These Quechua words simply mean, don&rsquo;t lie, don&rsquo;t steal, don&rsquo;t be lazy. &nbsp;Carlos repeated them often.<br />
With construction of the new house on higher ground completed, &nbsp;Carlos&rsquo;s parents brought him home. &ldquo;Your little sister Clara has been &nbsp;taking care of the pigs since you&rsquo;ve been away,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;From &nbsp;now on we want you to herd our sheep. Here&rsquo;s a sling Mama made &nbsp;for you. You&rsquo;ll need it when stray dogs bother you.&rdquo; Carlos surprised &nbsp;everyone by quickly becoming an expert at hitting birds.<br />
Carlos dressed in a patingo, a robe-like garment woven from hand spun wool by his mother, since little Indian boys did not wear pants. &nbsp;One afternoon while Carlos was playing with his sling, the sheep ran &nbsp;off. His mother called, &ldquo;Carlos, bring those sheep back!&rdquo; When he &nbsp;paid no attention, she came over, pulled up his patingo and gave him &nbsp;a good spanking on his bare bottom. Immediately he decided, I won&rsquo;t &nbsp;disobey anymore.<br />
After Carlos turned six, his maternal grandfather, Marcos Miranda, &nbsp;arranged for him to go to school in Palalla. &ldquo;Carlitos,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time &nbsp;for you to stop wearing a patingo and learn to dress like a boy. I have a &nbsp;gift for you.&rdquo; He handed Carlos a small bundle wrapped in a dirty cloth.<br />
Carlos unrolled the bundle carefully and looked in amazement. &nbsp;Pants! Real pants. They&rsquo;re the best pants I&rsquo;ve ever seen! The white pants,<br />
19</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">hand-spun and hand-woven from wool sheared from his grandfather&rsquo;s &nbsp;sheep, were the work of Grandma Miranda. I must keep them clean, &nbsp;he decided.<br />
Carlos had never worn pants before, and in a few days he noticed &nbsp;urine stains. Since no one ever washed clothing, it would only get &nbsp;worse. His white pants were filthy by the time his cousin Pedro came &nbsp;and took him to school for the first time.<br />
At school, he sat on a hard bench with no back and no desk or &nbsp;table. The Aymara teacher spoke no Spanish, yet she handed Carlos a &nbsp;Spanish book. Does this book talk? he wondered. Why did she give me &nbsp;this? He stared at the book all morning but didn&rsquo;t understand anything.<br />
Like him, the other children in the school spoke only Aymara. &nbsp;Since the teacher had never learned to read, she couldn&rsquo;t even teach &nbsp;the alphabet. The boys and girls enjoyed supervised play, but no one &nbsp;learned to read or write.<br />
The next year Carlos attended a school near his home in Ccota. &nbsp;When his second school year ended and still he had learned nothing, &nbsp;his parents were worried. What should we do for our son?<br />
&ldquo;A witch doctor should know how to read and write,&rdquo; Emilio said. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find a school where he can learn something.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Ignacia agreed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Colegio Fernando Stahl in &nbsp;Plater&iacute;a, but we&rsquo;ve decided never send him to a mission school.&rdquo; Just north of Carlos&rsquo;s home stood the highest mountain in the area, &nbsp;named San Francisco by the Spaniards, and called Ccota Ccollo by the &nbsp;native people. When school was not in session, Carlos often climbed &nbsp;this mountain, where his ancestors had worshiped the sun and made &nbsp;animal sacrifices. He enjoyed playing around the ruins of ancient &nbsp;chulpas while his sheep nibbled on short grass.<br />
Carlos&rsquo;s father, Emilio, liked to climb the mountain too. No one is &nbsp;using this land, he mused. Since the land around our old home is flooded, &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll plant potatoes up here near the top. He worked for days clearing &nbsp;rocks from a plot of ground. After more rain, he began digging up the &nbsp;land. Late one afternoon, his spade hit something hard.<br />
Reaching down, he picked up another rock. Before throwing it to &nbsp;the side, he noticed a clean spot glowing like gold in the afternoon sun. &nbsp;He wiped off the dirt. The whole rock, about three inches in diameter, &nbsp;looked like gold. Was this left here by the Incas? he wondered. Emilio &nbsp;carried the heavy rock home, put it on a shelf, and forgot about it until &nbsp;someone asked, &ldquo;Where did you get this huge gold nugget?&rdquo;<br />
20</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;Gold nugget? I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but it looks like gold,&rdquo; Emilio &nbsp;responded. When Carlos heard the word gold, he began keeping the &nbsp;nugget at the head of the bed where he slept.<br />
Poor Aymaras with no idea of the value of gold, the Velasquez fam ily kept the nugget until a relative offered to take it to Arequipa and sell &nbsp;it for them. The cousin reported that police confiscated it at the control &nbsp;going into Arequipa. Soon after this, the cousin built a fine new house. &nbsp;He must have lied, Emilio surmised, and sold the nugget for a lot of &nbsp;money and kept it for himself.<br />
The nugget was gone, but Carlos still loved to climb Mount Ccota &nbsp;Ccollo. On a clear day he could look southeast across Lake Titicaca &nbsp;and see Mount Illimani in Bolivia, reaching more than 21,000 feet into &nbsp;the brilliant blue sky. Directly east is what is known as the Peninsula &nbsp;and the main body of Lake Titicaca. Looking south across the pampa &nbsp;beyond Ccota, he could see Acora, where he had been baptized as a &nbsp;baby. Against a hill to the west lay the Plater&iacute;a Mission Station founded &nbsp;by pioneer missionary Stahl. Looking directly below, Carlos saw small &nbsp;farms on all sides.<br />
Early one morning he stood looking north across Puno Bay. &nbsp;Distant reeds growing in shallow water stretched out for miles.&nbsp;<br />
21</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Smoke rising from the reed bed caught his attention. What kind of &nbsp;people live out there? he wondered. He had heard tales about a strange &nbsp;tribe called Uros who lived on floating islands built out of reeds. One &nbsp;man claimed, &ldquo;Birds lay eggs in the reeds that are so big, one egg will &nbsp;fill a basket.&rdquo;<br />
Still looking across Lake Titicaca&rsquo;s blue waters, Carlos dreamed, &nbsp;Someday I&rsquo;ll visit these people that no one seems to know much about. I &nbsp;wonder if they practice witchcraft and worship spirits like my parents do. &nbsp;I want to find one of those big eggs.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:26px;">Chapter 9: The Forgotten Uros</span></strong></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">The challenge of surviving on little more than bread and water during their first three months in Cusco was nearly forgot ten by the time Carlos and Naomi returned to Ccota to visit &nbsp;their parents. God certainly blessed our three-and-a-half years in Cusco, &nbsp;Carlos thought. I wonder where will He lead us next.<br />
Both sets of grandparents were very happy to see their first grand son. One evening, Carlos stayed home while his parents attended a &nbsp;meeting in Plater&iacute;a, where they met Pastor Krause. &ldquo;Has Carlos re turned from Cusco?&rdquo; he asked them.<br />
&ldquo;Yes, he just arrived with his family, and we&rsquo;re very happy to see &nbsp;him,&rdquo; they responded.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Pastor Krause said. &ldquo;Please tell him to come see me in the &nbsp;Mission office. I need to talk with him.&rdquo;<br />
The next day, Carlos caught a ride on the back of a truck going to &nbsp;Puno. He went straight to the president&rsquo;s office at Mission headquarters. &nbsp;&ldquo;Pastor Krause,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My parents say you want to see me.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, we would like to invite you to work here in the office. A &nbsp;worker has just left, so we have a vacancy. You are a responsible em ployee, and we need you. You will be custodian and also work in the &nbsp;shipping department for the Book and Bible House. You&rsquo;ll be in charge &nbsp;of picking up the Mission mail. You&rsquo;ll have all the keys to the Mission.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos listened with intense interest. I like that word responsible, &nbsp;he thought. With God&rsquo;s help, that&rsquo;s what I always want to be. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I want to make clear,&rdquo; the Mission president &nbsp;continued. &ldquo;You will need to move here with your wife and family. You &nbsp;can rent a place to live, and we will help you with the rent. When can &nbsp;you come, Carlos? We need you now.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Pastor,&rdquo; Carlos answered. &ldquo;I will start looking for a place to live &nbsp;today, and as soon as I find something, I will go back to Ccota and &nbsp;move my family here.&rdquo;<br />

Little Indian &bull; Carlos and Lake Titicaca&rsquo;s Floating School<br />
&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; Pastor Krause exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be waiting for you.&rdquo; After working at the Mission for a few weeks, Carlos heard that a &nbsp;new missionary family would be arriving from the United States. He &nbsp;had learned to love the Krause and Olson families. What will this new &nbsp;family be like? he wondered.<br />
I, the writer of this book, and my wife Evelyn were the new mis sionary family. During our first year in the Lake Titicaca Mission, we &nbsp;traveled almost continually, hardly having any time to get to know &nbsp;Carlos. Even so, I recognized that Carlos Velasquez did his work well &nbsp;and never complained.<br />
Seeing the need for simple Bible lessons for the Aymara and &nbsp;Quechua Indians in our territory, I prepared thirty lessons, reviewing &nbsp;the material with the office staff at morning worships. Carlos showed &nbsp;great interest and made many valuable suggestions that we followed.<br />
The Lake Titicaca Mission territory included all of southern Peru. The lake itself, a lovely gem perched high in the Andes, is one of the marvels of the land of the ancient Incas.&nbsp;<br />
Its color changes constantly from deep green to brilliant blue to fading gray. When&nbsp;<br />
weather conditions are right, it&rsquo;s not unusual at sunset or sunrise to see it turn to daz<br />
zling gold.<br />
The peaceful calm of the morning is often broken by fierce winds and high waves,&nbsp;<br />
which can take the lives of even experienced sailors.&nbsp;<br />
The giant lake, covering 3,821 square miles, is &nbsp;nothing less than a small &nbsp;sea. Children of pre-Incan &nbsp;Aymaras and Quechua, who</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">68</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">are descendants of the Incas, still sail its waters, continuing in the cus toms of their forefathers.<br />
Of all the interesting people living around Lake Titicaca, perhaps &nbsp;the strangest are the Uros, who hid themselves away for centuries on &nbsp;small floating islands. The primitive Uros make their own islands from &nbsp;totora, a grass reed that usually grows in water from three to ten feet &nbsp;deep. Walking on these spongy islands gives one a sensation similar to &nbsp;trying to walk on a floating air mattress. One careless step and a foot &nbsp;ends up in ice-cold lake water.<br />
Like the islands, Uro houses and the mats they sleep on at night &nbsp;are made from totora reeds. The totora also serves for building their &nbsp;balsa boats. The Uros eat the roots of the reed, which is about as close &nbsp;as most of them ever get to a vegetable salad.<br />
No one really knows for sure, but many anthropologists believe &nbsp;the Uros, or Kape&ntilde;os, were once an oppressed tribe, who, about three &nbsp;hundred years ago, found themselves without land to cultivate. They &nbsp;moved into the totora reeds, which stretch out for miles in a shallow &nbsp;part of Lake Titicaca. Here they built small floating islands and lived, &nbsp;largely forgotten by the rest of the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">69</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">The name Kape&ntilde;o means fisherman, and the Uro men spend most &nbsp;of their time catching fish, which serve as the principal part of their &nbsp;diet and only means of livelihood. They vary their diet by eating fish fresh, dried, or baked. The women usually boil their fish in earthen pots in outdoor kitchens.<br />
Occasionally, the Uros barter fish for grain, legumes, and chu&ntilde;os. Chu&ntilde;os are dehydrated potatoes popular all around the highlands of Peru and Bolivia. After the potatoes are harvested, they are left on the ground at night to freeze.&nbsp;<br />
The next day, after the potatoes have thawed in the morning sun, Indian women trample on them with bare feet to squeeze out the water. After eight or &nbsp;ten days of this trampling process, the &nbsp;potatoes are completely dehydrated &nbsp;and will keep for</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">70</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">The floating islands at 12,500 feet above sea level compare in eleva tion to some of the highest peaks in the United States and are not much &nbsp;lower than Mount Whitney. The temperature at night is freezing cold, &nbsp;with frost nearly every night during much of the year. Even though the &nbsp;sun is bright during the day, the air stays cool.<br />
When my wife and I learned about the Uros, we said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to &nbsp;reach these people with the gospel. Let&rsquo;s make helping the Uros our &nbsp;personal project.&rdquo; The Mission had no boat, so I bought a seventeen foot Klepper kayak from a German company. The manager of the rail road gave me a small piece of steel rail, which I mounted on a cross bar, and then I attached a three-horsepower Johnson motor to power &nbsp;the boat.<br />
Puno is an international port serving shipping between Peru and &nbsp;Bolivia. Authorities informed me I would be required to get a pilot&rsquo;s &nbsp;license to travel by boat on Lake Titicaca. Strange, I thought, a license &nbsp;to use a little kayak? To make sure we were covered, my wife and I both &nbsp;got pilot&rsquo;s licenses. Evelyn became the first woman to ever get a license &nbsp;to pilot a boat on Lake Titicaca.<br />
Each time we wanted to leave Puno and go out on the lake, we &nbsp;had to report to the Peruvian navy and fill out a form saying where &nbsp;we were going and when we planned to return. For our first trip, we &nbsp;put down Amantan&iacute; and Torani Pata as the places we would be going. &nbsp;We traveled out through a channel used by ships. &ldquo;This is glorious,&rdquo; I &nbsp;called to Evelyn above the noise of the motor. &ldquo;Look! There are hundreds of flamingos.&rdquo; As we came closer, many of these beautiful birds &nbsp;took flight.&nbsp;<br />
We had the required pilot&rsquo;s license, but we knew nothing about &nbsp;conditions for travel on the lake. We left Puno late in the day, and by &nbsp;three in the afternoon a wind came up. We were fighting waves and &nbsp;making little progress. Finally I said, &ldquo;Evelyn, we&rsquo;d better forget going &nbsp;out into the main lake where Amantan&iacute; is located. If it&rsquo;s this rough in &nbsp;the bay, it will be much worse on the main lake. Let&rsquo;s go to Torani Pata. &nbsp;Next time, we&rsquo;ll leave early in the morning while the lake is smooth.&rdquo;<br />
Late in the afternoon we headed in through the totora reeds to the &nbsp;floating islands of Torani Pata. The water, protected by reeds, was calm, &nbsp;and we cut the motor and floated up alongside a balsa holding a large &nbsp;clay pot. Never dreaming this was a sacred shrine where the supersti<br />
tious Uros came to pray to the spirits, we planned to move quietly up &nbsp;to one of the floating islands and make contact.<br />
71</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">In seconds we heard men shouting. Carrying long poles, they ran, &nbsp;jumped in their balsas, and headed toward us. Using the long poles, they &nbsp;chased us off. We thanked God the little motor started on the first pull &nbsp;of the starter cord, and we quickly moved away from the angry Uros.<br />
We later learned that the Uros claimed we dove into the lake and &nbsp;disappeared. Unbeknownst to us, that night, the island&rsquo;s witch doctor &nbsp;prayed asking the spirits for us to die. He told his people to kill us if we &nbsp;ever returned.<br />
We knew nothing about what the Uros were up to, but soon &nbsp;we would be doing some serious praying ourselves. The golden sun &nbsp;dropped beyond the western Andes, and dark black clouds crept &nbsp;across the sky. Like anyplace near the equator, there is no twilight, &nbsp;and darkness immediately came over the lake. We had planned to &nbsp;reach our destination before dark and were counting on moonlight &nbsp;if we didn&rsquo;t.<br />
With the moon hidden by clouds, we were in deep trouble. Unable &nbsp;to see anything, we kept running into marshy areas, and our propeller &nbsp;got tangled up with moss and weeds. &ldquo;We need to go farther south to &nbsp;get out of this,&rdquo; I told Evelyn, who by now wondered why she had ever &nbsp;agreed to the trip. In the dense darkness, I had no idea where south &nbsp;was. After unclogging the propeller several times, we headed in a different direction.<br />
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, dear,&rdquo; I assured my wife. &ldquo;The company responsible &nbsp;for shipping between Peru and Bolivia keeps lamps lit at night on the &nbsp;south end of the channel. We&rsquo;ll find the lights and head for them. Once &nbsp;we get into the channel, it will be easy to find our way back to Puno.&rdquo;<br />
After what seemed like hours, we were not finding any lights. &nbsp;Perhaps we&rsquo;re going in circles, I thought, because once in a while we got &nbsp;back into shallow areas and our propeller became clogged with water &nbsp;plants again. Even with the heavy lined leather jackets we wore, we &nbsp;were getting cold.<br />
Before starting the motor after cleaning out the weeds again, I said, &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not finding the channel. I don&rsquo;t think God wants us to spend &nbsp;the rest of the night on the lake. Let&rsquo;s pray.&rdquo; We both prayed. &ldquo;Lord, you &nbsp;know where the channel is. Please help us find it.&rdquo;<br />
I had hardly started the little Johnson motor again when a hole &nbsp;opened up in the clouds, and bright moonlight penetrated the dark ness. &ldquo;Thank you, Lord,&rdquo; I prayed. &ldquo;You are so good to answer our &nbsp;prayer immediately.&rdquo;<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;Evelyn, look!&rdquo; I leaned forward so she could hear over the sound &nbsp;of the motor. &ldquo;I see the outline of the Curva de Chimo. The channel&rsquo;s &nbsp;close by!&rdquo;<br />
I looked at my watch. It was after ten. We had been lost on the &nbsp;lake for almost four hours. In minutes we reached the channel, where &nbsp;a tower on each side held a lamp. Lamps, but no light! What&rsquo;s wrong? I &nbsp;wondered. The lamps are out. We didn&rsquo;t know that the workers for the &nbsp;shipping company had gone on strike, leaving the lamps unlit.<br />
As we entered the channel, clouds covered the moon, leaving us &nbsp;in darkness. It didn&rsquo;t matter. Soon we could see the lights of Puno and &nbsp;headed straight for the port. We had another prayer. &ldquo;Thank you, Lord, &nbsp;for opening up the clouds and giving us moonlight long enough to find &nbsp;our way home. Please bless and guide our work as we take the gospel &nbsp;light to those who live in darkness.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
After making several trips in our kayak, we realized it wasn&rsquo;t prac tical for the kind of trips we needed to make and sold it. Chris Craft &nbsp;had a close-out sale on small boat kits, and a missionary coming to &nbsp;Peru brought one for us, which we purchased at a give-away price. On &nbsp;evenings when we were home and not holding meetings, my wife and &nbsp;I worked together, putting in hundreds of screws while our baby, Gail, &nbsp;slept beside us. When the hull was finished, we covered it with fiber &nbsp;glass and painted it with marine paint imported from the United States.<br />
We mounted a forty-horsepower Mercury outboard motor on the &nbsp;back and christened the boat Maranatha. &ldquo;Maranatha,&rdquo; taken from the &nbsp;King James Version of the Bible, is a prayer meaning, &ldquo;Oh, Lord come&rdquo; &nbsp;(1 Corinthians 16:22). Every time people asked us what Maranatha &nbsp;means, we told them about Jesus&rsquo; promise to return and take us to &nbsp;heaven. We taught people around Lake Titicaca to sing:<br />
Maranatha, the Lord is coming.<br />
Maranatha, the Lord is coming.<br />
It&rsquo;s our hope and our song, For it cheers us along, Maranatha, the Lord is coming.<br />
As we planned our first trip in the new boat, I said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back &nbsp;to the floating islands.&rdquo; Evelyn reminded me how we&rsquo;d been chased off &nbsp;on our first try to visit these primitive people. &ldquo;Whatever we do,&rdquo; she &nbsp;insisted, &ldquo;we need to take a good interpreter.&rdquo;<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;Yes, and you&rsquo;re a nurse. Jesus spent a lot of time healing the sick. &nbsp;I believe medical ministry is the key to reaching the hearts and minds &nbsp;of the Uros. My old college friend, Bill Jamerson, served as a medical &nbsp;technician in the United States Army during World War II. He started &nbsp;a mobile clinic service for Indians living in the highlands of Bolivia.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking about inviting him to go with us to visit the float ing islands?&rdquo; Evelyn asked.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Yes. I know Bill lives 800 miles away in Lima, but I think we can &nbsp;work it out. The two of you can do medical work.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;OK,&rdquo; Evelyn agreed. &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t forget we need the best interpreter &nbsp;you can find.&rdquo;<br />

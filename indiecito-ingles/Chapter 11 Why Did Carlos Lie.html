<p><strong><span style="font-size:26px;">Chapter 11: Why Did Carlos Lie?</span></strong></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">Carlos knew his Bible well. The inspired Word says, &ldquo;Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord&rdquo; (Proverbs 12:22a). Why &nbsp;would a man of strong convictions, a man who refused to wear &nbsp;a necktie because he believed it was just a stupid custom, tell an out right lie? Why would a man who loves Jesus break the commandment &nbsp;saying, &ldquo;You shall not bear false witness&rdquo; (Exodus 20:16)? Christians may ask, Why did God choose a murderer like Moses &nbsp;to deliver His chosen people from Egypt? Why did He save the harlot, &nbsp;Rahab, who lied about hiding the Israelite spies when they checked out &nbsp;Jericho?<br />
Fifty years after saying, &ldquo;Yes, they want a school,&rdquo; Carlos confessed &nbsp;to me, saying, &ldquo;I lied.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;But, Carlos,&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;<br />
His eyes dropped as he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. God knows. Perhaps &nbsp;He had a plan.&rdquo;<br />
A forgiving God often uses imperfect people. The Holy Spirit &nbsp;leads us to confess our sins. The wise man declared, &ldquo;Those who deal &nbsp;truthfully are His delight&rdquo; (Proverbs 12:22b). I thanked Carlos for tell ing me how it really was, yet I will always wonder, Would I be writing &nbsp;about a floating school on Lake Titicaca if Carlos had told me the truth? Only God has the answer. God could have worked something out even &nbsp;if Carlos had told us the Uros didn&rsquo;t want a school.<br />
Believing Carlos&rsquo;s lie, I had promoted a floating school. Knowing &nbsp;what the missionaries did not know&mdash;the Uros living on the floating &nbsp;island of Torani Pata did not want a school&mdash;Carlos agonized. Is teach ing the Uros really what God wants me to do? How can I take my wife &nbsp;and three children to live with such filthy people? It&rsquo;s infested with fleas, &nbsp;and the people are covered with lice. The questions went on. What will &nbsp;we eat? Where will we get water to drink? All the water around the floating islands is contaminated.<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Carlos rushed home to talk with his wife. Why me? he kept asking &nbsp;himself. Why don&rsquo;t they find someone else to teach the Uros? He found &nbsp;her busy sewing. &ldquo;Naomi!&rdquo; he called.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re home early today,&rdquo; she responded.<br />
&ldquo;Yes, we need to talk.&rdquo; Trying to catch his breath, he blurted out, &nbsp;&ldquo;Naomi, the Mission wants us to move.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Where do they want us to go?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re building a floating school for the Uros. They want us to &nbsp;live in a tiny room attached to the back of it. They&rsquo;ve asked me to teach, &nbsp;but I don&rsquo;t want to go.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Why? That will be a great opportunity for us. You can be the first &nbsp;teacher to reach these people with the story of Jesus. Carlos, this is a &nbsp;call from God,&rdquo; she encouraged.<br />
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Carlos said, &ldquo;but these people are ignorant, they&rsquo;re filthy, &nbsp;they&rsquo;re superstitious, and they don&rsquo;t want a school. How can our family &nbsp;live in a place like that?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Carlos,&rdquo; Naomi responded. &ldquo;Remember how Pastor and Mrs. &nbsp;Stahl came to Peru as missionaries. Our grandparents lived miserable &nbsp;lives. They suffered constant fear and worshiped spirits. They knew &nbsp;nothing about cleanliness and hygiene. Your grandparents rejected the &nbsp;message&mdash;they wanted nothing to do with a new way of life. In spite of &nbsp;this, the work started by Pastor Stahl transformed our lives.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Carlos agreed. &ldquo;But the Uros are worse than our &nbsp;grandparents.&rdquo;<br />
Naomi smiled at her husband. &ldquo;Not only your grandparents, but &nbsp;your parents turned against the way of life taught by the missionaries. &nbsp;Then you bought a Bible, rebelled against your parents, and went to &nbsp;an Adventist school. God changed your life and used you to bring the &nbsp;Word of God to your parents. The Uros need the Word of God too. &nbsp;God can use you to change their lives. This is a call from God. We need &nbsp;to go.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos thought the matter over. What Naomi says is true. We are &nbsp;happy today because missionaries like Pastor Stahl brought hope and &nbsp;taught us how to live. Now we can be missionaries and help the Uros find &nbsp;a better way of life.<br />
Looking at Naomi, he said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;ve been afraid of failure, &nbsp;but there can be no failure with God. Pastor Stahl must have had a &nbsp;sad heart when people like my grandparents rejected the message, but &nbsp;seeds of truth were sown. The schools he started have greatly benefited<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">the lives of Aymaras and Quechuas living on the Altiplano around &nbsp;Lake Titicaca.&rdquo;<br />
Husband and wife got on their knees together and thanked God &nbsp;for a new opportunity to serve. After praying together, Carlos gave &nbsp;Naomi a big abrazo. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful to God for a godly wife like you,&rdquo; he &nbsp;said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had some tough times together. I&rsquo;ll never forget how you &nbsp;went out and worked so we could eat when the school at Caijano Pata &nbsp;failed to pay my salary.&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Thank you for always encouraging me,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Pastor &nbsp;Sullivan we are accepting the invitation to teach in the new floating &nbsp;school. I see you&rsquo;ve been sewing today. You could make uniforms for &nbsp;the children and teach their mothers to sew.&rdquo;<br />
The school year in Peru begins in March. Carlos began preparing &nbsp;materials&mdash;blackboard, chalk, flannel graph, notebooks, pencils. And &nbsp;every student would need a Bible. He prayed constantly. &ldquo;Dear Lord, &nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t taught school for several years. Please help me do my best as &nbsp;a teacher.&rdquo;<br />
Construction on the floating school took longer than planned, &nbsp;and when March arrived, the building was not ready. Anxious to see &nbsp;students who had never been to school before get off to a good start, &nbsp;Carlos decided to start classes without a building. The mission launch &nbsp;was not available, so he loaded all of his equipment on the back of a &nbsp;truck headed for Curva de Chimo.<br />
Naomi left their three sleeping children to tell her husband good bye. As the truck pulled out she called, &ldquo;Carlos, I&rsquo;ll be praying for you. &nbsp;God will give you success.&rdquo;<br />
Dust blew in Carlos&rsquo;s face as the truck bounced along on the wash board road. I&rsquo;m so blessed to have a wife like Naomi, he thought. It will &nbsp;be a lot better when she and the children can join me.<br />
At Chimo, he hired a man with two balsa boats to take him to &nbsp;the floating island of Torani Pata. Towing the second balsa, both men &nbsp;paddled, but it still took five hours to go less than five miles.<br />
The Uros appeared agitated as Carlos stepped out on the spongy &nbsp;island and began unloading school supplies. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Carlos Velasquez,&rdquo; he &nbsp;announced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve visited you many times.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You must be a devil!&rdquo; the Uros exclaimed. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be Se&ntilde;or &nbsp;Velasquez. He always comes in a launch. You&rsquo;ve come here to deceive us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Carlos said. &ldquo;The mission launch was not available, so I &nbsp;came in a balsa. I&rsquo;m here to start a school and teach your children to<br />
85</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">read and write.&rdquo; He looked around at all the filth. How can I live with &nbsp;fleas and lice? Turning to the men, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you bread and &nbsp;money if you build a little island.&rdquo; The Uros worked the rest of the day &nbsp;bringing totora reeds for the island.<br />
It became dark almost instantly at sunset, and the Uros disap peared into their totora huts. Carlos climbed in his sleeping bag and &nbsp;stretched out, looking up at bright stars filling the night sky. &ldquo;Dear &nbsp;Lord,&rdquo; he prayed. &ldquo;You brought me to this place. Please help me show &nbsp;these people a better way of life. Send your angels to watch over my &nbsp;family back in Puno.&rdquo;<br />
While falling asleep, he imagined, I&rsquo;m sinking, I&rsquo;m sinking. I don&rsquo;t &nbsp;think this new island is very thick. Around midnight he felt something &nbsp;very cold. He rolled over. No wonder I&rsquo;m cold. Everything&rsquo;s wet. They &nbsp;didn&rsquo;t put down enough layers of dried totora to keep me out of the water.<br />
With his sleeping bag soaked, he put on dry clothes and spent the rest &nbsp;of the night exercising to stay warm.<br />
I can&rsquo;t let a bad night discourage me, he determined. At least I&rsquo;m still alive and able to welcome the rising sun. He called the men who had helped build his island. &ldquo;We need to work on this and do a better job,&rdquo; he said kindly. &ldquo;I will help you.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
During the morning, one man confided, &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Velasquez, we&rsquo;re helping you for money, but we don&rsquo;t want you here. The witch doctor says we should kill you.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Recognizing his life was in danger, Carlos prayed continually. The workers added reeds to the island &nbsp;and even built a small totora shelter &nbsp;much like their own reed huts. This &nbsp;provided a little protection from wind and rain and gave Carlos a place to store his things. When the work was complete, Carlos began visiting Uro families &nbsp;to register children for school. It didn&rsquo;t take long to discover they defi nitely did not want a school. One family declared, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pishtaco, &nbsp;you came here to kill our children and take their grease.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">86<br />

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:26px;">The father of another family shouted, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a gringo! Leave &nbsp;us alone.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos laughed. &ldquo;Me, a gringo? Gringos don&rsquo;t speak Aymara. Look &nbsp;at the color of my skin. I&rsquo;m no gringo.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes, you are. You painted your skin to make us think you are one &nbsp;of us, but you&rsquo;re a gringo. You came here to destroy the fish in our lake. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll make sure you die before you destroy us.&rdquo;<br />
As evening shadows crept across the floating islands, Carlos &nbsp;headed to his own little hut. A man approached and demanded, &ldquo;Why &nbsp;did you come here?&rdquo; Without another word he went back to his balsa and vanished into the night.<br />
Perplexed, Carlos crawled into his sleeping bag, which had dried &nbsp;out during the day, and prayed. &ldquo;Father in heaven,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;You alone &nbsp;can change the minds of these superstitious people. Please help them &nbsp;understand I came to help and not harm. They are afraid and want to &nbsp;kill me. Please send angels to keep me safe and watch over my family &nbsp;in Puno.&rdquo;<br />
Carlos did not know that while he was praying, the old blind witch &nbsp;doctor was burning incense and mumbling incantations to make con tact with the spirits.<br />
While Carlos was eating breakfast in the morning, an older Uro &nbsp;man approached. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The witch doctor prayed to the &nbsp;spirits last night. He received a message saying, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything to &nbsp;hurt the teacher. He will help you and your people.&rsquo; &rdquo;<br />
Incredible! Carlos thought. The witch doctor tries to contact spirits &nbsp;of devils. Our powerful God intervenes and sends the Holy Spirit with a &nbsp;message to protect me. Without this, they would carry out their plan to &nbsp;kill me.<br />
Carlos thanked the old man, who hurried away, fearful of being &nbsp;seen talking with the teacher. He thought, Naomi was right when she &nbsp;said, &ldquo;This is a call from God.&rdquo; The Lord not only brought me here, but He &nbsp;has given a message to the witch doctor not to harm me. Jesus is the best &nbsp;friend I can ever have. I don&rsquo;t need to be afraid. His angels will protect me.<br />
He found it difficult to walk on the spongy floating islands, yet &nbsp;Carlos continued going from hut to hut, patiently explaining the ad vantages of having children learn to read and write. Too often parents &nbsp;responded saying, &ldquo;No! No! Our children will never go to your school.&rdquo; &nbsp;In spite of the almost constant objections, by Friday, sixteen children &nbsp;were registered for classes scheduled to begin on Monday.<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">After a lonely week, Carlos longed to spend Sabbath with his family in Puno.<br />
Buthow can I get there? he pondered.<br />
Looking out over the lake, he saw a sailboat coming from Amantan&iacute; on its way to Puno. The men at Torani Pata were sleeping after a night of fishing. He quickly paid a woman with a balsa to take him out. He signaled for the boat to stop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">The sail dropped, bringing the boat to a stop, and Carlos climbed in. The boat owner looked in disgust. It&rsquo;s just another Indian! He called out in anger, &ldquo;Who said, &lsquo;Drop the sail, it&rsquo;s a policeman&rsquo;?&rdquo; Silence&mdash;no one answered. Realizing what had happened, Carlos thought, It must have been an angel&mdash;God knows I&rsquo;ve had a rough week and need to get home.<br />
Sailors cursed as they struggled to get the sail up again. Arriving in Puno, Carlos asked his family to pray that God would continue to guide in the work of starting a new school for people who didn&rsquo;t want a school.<br />
The Uros avoided Carlos when he returned to the islands on Sunday. As he crawled into his sleeping bag that night, he wondered, Will the children I&rsquo;ve registered for classes really show up? Knowing the real test would come in the morning, he prayed, &ldquo;Lord, this is Your work. Please send the children so I can start classes.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">88</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Awakened by the songs of birds at sunrise, Carlos soon had his blackboard and other school supplies ready for school to begin. Just before 8:00 a.m. he blew his whistle. The children began arriving in balsas. This is amazing, he thought as he counted. All sixteen are here.<br />
He asked the children to form two lines. &ldquo;We are going to talk to the God of heaven,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;the God who made you and this beautiful lake where you live.&rdquo; He prayed a simple prayer asking God to bless the boys and girls and their families. &ldquo;Help us learn all the good things You want us to know.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">With no desks of any kind, he asked the children to help him place long wooden planks on boxes. The youngsters sat on the totora under the planks that provided a place for them to write. He gave out notepads and pencils and asked the children to copy everything he wrote<br />
on the blackboard. First he wrote a-e-i-o-u. Carlos had the students pronounce each letter. Next, came the entire alphabet. Children who had never held a pencil in their hand before struggled to copy the letters. Carlos explained, &ldquo;You will use these letters to form words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">You are going to learn Spanish. It&rsquo;s important to know the language of our country.&rdquo; His demeanor and quiet way kept the attention of the children. He smiled at his students. &ldquo;The first Spanish word I ever learned was indio. I rode a burro into Puno to go to school, and children on the street shouted, indiocito&mdash;little Indian.&rdquo; He continued, &ldquo;My parents are</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">89</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Aymara Indians, so I speak Aymara, but I&rsquo;m glad I learned Spanish, as there are many important books to read in Spanish. &ldquo;The first book I ever bought was a Spanish Bible. It changed my life. You will learn to read the Bible too.&rdquo; To help the children understand<br />
about Jesus, he showed them a picture he painted at art school in Puno&mdash;a picture of Jesus standing in a balsa boat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">When the children went home that afternoon, they already knew a few Spanish words. The next morning they greeted their teacher saying &ldquo;Buenos d&iacute;as, profesor!&rdquo; By Friday they would know much more. When he became a Christian, Carlos had chosen to honor Jesus and &ldquo;remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy&rdquo; (Exodus 20:8).<br />

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Saturday, the seventh day of the week, is called S&aacute;bado, or Sabbath, in Spanish. While working at the Mission office in Puno, he attended evening classes at the School of Bellas Artes to improve his painting skills. Students noticed he always missed Friday evening classes. &ldquo;Where are you on Friday nights?&rdquo; they asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worshiping God on His holy Sabbath,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;The Bible says, &lsquo;From evening to evening, you shall celebrate your sabbath&rsquo; &rdquo;(Leviticus 23:32). &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Word teaches that evening begins at sundown. It says, &lsquo;At twilight, at the going down of the sun,&rsquo; (Deuteronomy 16:6). I keep the Lord&rsquo;s Sabbath from sundown to sundown.&rdquo; From then on when Carlos arrived at art class, students would always say, &ldquo;Here comes Sundown.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">At the close of classes in the floating school on the first Friday, Carlos announced, &ldquo;There will be no school tomorrow. S&aacute;bado [Saturday, the seventh day of the week] is a very special day. Please come and bring your friends, and we will worship God.&rdquo; He prepared for the Sabbath, and from his own little island watched the sun sink behind distant hills. It&rsquo;s so lonely here, Carlos thought as he began to pray. &ldquo;Thank you, Lord, for sending your angels to watch over me during the first week of school. Help me live in a way that will inspire the Uros to want to serve You too. Be with Naomi and the children.&rdquo;<br />
After pouring his heart out to God, he lit a lamp and read the Bible before getting into his sleeping bag. Will the children come tomorrow? he wondered. Will they bring some of their friends? Will the parents understand? The children did come&mdash;more than had come on any day for school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">Teaching children to sing who had never sung in their life proved difficult, but little by little their singing improved. Some curious mothers stood in the back and watched. Carlos had the children close their eyes while he talked to the great God of heaven. He told Bible stories. In the afternoon, he visited some of the parents. I have a long way to go to win their confidence, he realized. At least a few seem happy with what their children are learning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">After just a week, they&rsquo;re all able to write their own names. Some parents remained unfriendly, but Carlos and his classes became a big attraction for children who were eager to learn. Each time he prepared a meal, they stood around watching. They wanted to eat what he ate. He had not brought enough to feed others, so he shared tiny pieces when they asked for his food.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">91</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">---</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:26px;">The Mission launch came with exciting news during the last week of March. &ldquo;The roof is on the floating school. We&rsquo;ll tow it out the first of next week. To avoid too much wind resistance, we will put on the metal siding and install the windows and door after we get here.&rdquo;<br />
